quoted O

in O

support O

said O
that O
many O
black O

feel O
bitter O
about O

, O
so O
they O
, O
too O
, O
support O
black O
candidates O
uncritically O

said O
that O

contributed O
more O
to O

over O
the B-DATE
years I-DATE

, O
Mr. O

not O

from O

, O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
instinctively O
reached O
for O
the O
vernacular O
. O

He O
said O
Jews B-NORP
were O
`` O
sick O
with O
complexes O

called O
David B-PERSON

, O
`` O

fancy O
shvartze O
with O
a O

'' O

If O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
had O
used O
less O
derogatory O
language O
to O
articulate O
his O
amateur O
analysis O
of O
the O
voting O
behavior O
of O
his O
fellow O
New B-NORP

would O
the O
water O
be O
quite O
so O
hot O
? O

It O
probably O
would O
, O
because O
few O
or O
none O
of O
the O
people O
upset O
by O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
's O
remarks O
have O
bothered O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
substance O
of O
his O
comments O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
used O
insulting O
language O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
some O
of O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON

critics O
have O
implied O
that O
his O
type O
of O
ethnic O
humor O
is O
itself O
a O
form O
of O
racism O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
New B-GPE
York I-GPE
state O
counsel O
for O
the O
NAACP B-ORG
said O
that O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
is O
`` O
like O
a O

. O

People O
are O
fast O
leaving O
the O
place O
where O
he O
is O
stuck O
. O
'' O

These O
critics O
fail O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
type O
of O
ethnic O
humor O
that O
aims O
at O
disparaging O
another O
group O
, O
such O
as O
`` O
Polish B-NORP
jokes O
'' O
; O
and O
the O
type O
that O
is O
double O
- O
edged O
, O
aiming O
inward O
as O
well O
as O
outward O
. O

The O
latter O
typically O
is O
the O
humor O
of O
the O
underdog O
, O
and O
it O
was O
perfected O
by O
both O

Clearly O
, O
the O
question O
with O
`` O

'' O
is O
not O
whether O

over O

but O
whether O

at O
all O

So O
far O
, O
the O
bubbles O
have O
been O
few O
and O
far O
between O
. O

Part O
of O
the O
problem O
is O
the O
tendency O
of O
all O
sitcoms O
, O
ever O
since O
the B-DATE
didactic I-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
Norman B-PERSON
Lear I-PERSON
, O
to O
preach O
about O
social O
issues O
. O

To O
some O
extent O
, O
this O
tendency O
emerges O
whenever O
the O
show O
tries O
to O
enlighten O
us O
about O
ethnic O
stereotypes O
by O
reversing O
them O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Michael B-PERSON
dislikes O
Jackie B-PERSON
not O
because O
he O
's O
a O
shrewd O
Jewish B-NORP
businessman O
, O
but O
because O
he O
quits O
his O
well O
- O
paying O
job O
as O
a O
salesman O
in O
order O
to O
become O
a O
social O
worker O
. O

Even O
more O
problematic O
is O
the O
incompatibility O
between O
sitcom O
preachiness O
and O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
's O
comic O
persona O
. O

The O
best O
moments O
in O
the O

occur O
at O
the O
beginning O
and O
the O
end O
-LRB- O
and O
occasionally O
in O
the O
middle O
-RRB- O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
slips O
into O
his O
standup O
mode O
and O
starts O
meting O
out O
that O
old O
- O
fashioned O
Jewish B-NORP
mischief O
to O
other O
people O
as O
well O
as O
to O
himself O
. O

But O
too O
often O
, O
these O
routines O
lack O
spark O
because O
this O
sitcom O
, O
like O
all O
sitcoms O
, O
is O
timid O
about O
confronting O
Mr. O
Mason B-PERSON
's O
stock O
in O
trade O
- O
ethnic O
differences O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
suggesting O
that O
the O
producers O
start O
putting O
together O
episodes O
about O
topics O
like O
the O
Catholic B-NORP
- O
Jewish O
dispute O
over O
the O
Carmelite B-NORP

That O
issue O
, O
like O
racial O
tensions O
in O
New B-GPE

, O
will O

not O
heat O

before O
it O
can O

But O
I O
am O
suggesting O
that O
they O
stop O
requiring O
Mr. O

to O
interrupt O
his O
classic O

some O

about O

I O
think O
the O

a O

The O

What O
we O
know O
about O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
is O
that O
he O
had O
changed O
a O
lot O
. O

He O
had O
Islamic B-NORP
tendecies O
and O
acts O
which O
many O
Iraqis B-NORP
mentioned O
, O
saying O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
supported O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
the O
building O
of O
mosques O
centers O
for O
memorizing O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
charities O
, O
and O
the O
dancer O
's O
punishment O
was O
death O
. O

He O
had O
many O
works O
. O

But O
some O
explained O
his O
Islamic B-PERSON
tendency O
by O
saying O
that O
he O
was O
currying O
favor O
with O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
as O
if O
they O
were O
reading O
his O
mind O
. O

I O
have O
followed O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
, O
especially O
in O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
I O
noticed O
about O
him O
was O
that O
there O
was O
religion O
but O
there O
was O
injustice O
and O
coarseness O
. O

And O
his O
punishment O
was O
unjust O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
dancer O
would O
be O
killed O
after O
second B-ORDINAL
offence O
. O

I O
did O
not O
expect O
anyone O
to O
kill O
the O
dancer O
unless O
good O
would O
come O
of O
it O
, O
but O
like O
the O
most O
idiots O
his O
aim O
was O
correct O
but O
the O
method O
was O
wrong O
. O

Another O
example O
- O
after O
his O
son O
Udai B-PERSON
harmed O
the O
Iraqi B-NORP
people O
and O
attacked O
women O
and O
other O
matters O
, O
Saddam B-PERSON
ordered O
him O
to O
be O
killed O
. O

And O
in O
fact O
he O
was O
fired O
on O
but O
survived O
miraculously O
, O
after O
being O
hit O
with O
several O
fatal O
shots O
some O
of O
which O
hit O
his O
spine O
. O

This O
is O
a O
sign O
that O
there O
was O
good O
in O
him O
otherwise O
he O
would O
not O
have O
ordered O
the O
killing O
of O
his O
son O
, O
his O
own O
child O
. O

But O
he O
was O
not O
a O
scholar O
nor O
feared O
in O
God O
. O

I O
myself O
heard O
from O
some O
people O
who O
were O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
about O
the O
things O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
used O
to O
do O
, O
and O
could O
not O
be O
reasonably O
done O
by O
anyone O
other O
than O
a O
good O
Moslem B-NORP
To O
the O
extent O
that O
many O
said O
of O
his O
actions O
that O
they O
were O
only O
to O
gain O
favor O
amongst O
the O
Sunnis B-NORP
and O
the O
religious O
. O

But O
we O
judge O
by O
the O
appearances O
and O
his O
end O
was O
in O
line O
with O
the O
appearance O
. O

In O
his O
last B-ORDINAL
days O
during O
the O
fall O
of O
Baghdad B-GPE
and O
his O
disappearance O
, O
an O
old O
woman O
or O
man O
said O
on O
TV O
on O
al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Jazeera I-ORG
channel O
that O
he O
was O
hiding O
in O
her O
house O
and O
had O
had O
his O
prayer O
mat O
with O
him O
and O
was O
always O
praying O
and O
reading O
the O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Do O
we O
say O
no O
, O
this O
is O
hypocrisy O
? O

Bear O
in O
mind O
that O
many O
have O
said O
that O
Saddam B-PERSON
prayed O
regularly O
especially O
after O
he O
was O
put O
in O
prison O
by O
the O
Rafida B-PERSON
and O
their O
masters O
. O

Some O
of O
those O
who O
said O
that O
he O
was O
always O
praying O
and O
reading O
the O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART
are O
the O
Christians B-NORP
who O
visited O
him O
in O
his O
prison O
cell O
. O

Finally O
, O
during O
his O
hanging O
, O
the O
Rafida B-PERSON
tried O
to O
distract O
him O
and O
keep O
him O
from O
saying O
the O
Creed O
before O
his O
death O
. O

They O
were O
trying O
everything O
they O
could O
but O
we O
say O
that O
God O
made O
him O
steadfast O
for O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
see O
that O
he O
died O
acknowledging O
God O
. O

The O
Rafida B-PERSON
were O
shouting O
provocative O
words O
such O
as O
Muqtada B-PERSON
and O
al B-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Sadr I-PERSON
so O
that O
he O
would O
lose O
control O
and O
curse O
them O
, O
then O
they O
would O
have O
killed O
him O
. O

So O
they O
could O
show O
the O
clip O
in O
which O
there O
is O
cursing O
and O
insults O
from O
Saddam B-PERSON
and O
cut O
the O
rest O
. O

However O
he O
remained O
steadfast O
in O
saying O
the O
creed O
and O
was O
killed O
whilst O
saying O
it O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
this O
could O
n't O
have O
happened O
without O
God O
making O
him O
steadfast O
otherwise O
God O
would O
not O
have O
made O
him O
steadfast O
in O
it O
. O

As O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
sheikhs O
says O
, O
many O
people O
when O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
say O
the O
creed O
and O
were O
being O
dictated O
the O
creed O
by O
those O
present O
would O
murmur O
" O
Did O
love O
see O
drunkards O
? O
" O

Other O
people O
say O
, O
I O
have O
not O
said O
it O
while O
I O
was O
alive O
and O
you O
want O
me O
to O
say O
it O
when O
I O
am O
dying O
... O
the O
truth O
is O
what O
is O
apparent O
. O

But O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
was O
reasonable O
in O
that O
he O
repented O
and O
turned O
to O
his O
creator O
who O
receives O
the O
repentance O
from O
his O
slave O
. O

And O
he O
committed O
himself O
to O
the O
worship O
of O
God O
. O
And O
remained O
loyal O
to O
God O
. O

I O
ask O
God O
to O
have O
mercy O
on O
him O
and O
to O
forgive O
him O
and O
to O
give O
him O
an O
ample O
dwelling O
in O
his O
paradise O

President O

you O

you O

you O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON

What O

you O

I O

I O
thought O
you O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
We O
have O
nothing O
to O
apologize O
for O
, O
you O
constituted O
a O
danger O
to O
your O
neighbors O

tried O
to O
acquire O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
and O
practiced O
dictatorship O
over O
your O
people O
and O
so O
it O
was O
only O
natural O
that O
we O
extended O
our O
hand O
to O
the O
people O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
to O
rid O
them O
of O
the O

: O
I O
know O
that O
you O

and O
I O
know O
that O
your O
president O
is O
no O
less O
ignorant O

it O
seems O
that O
you O
have O
continued O

lie O

the O
extent O
that O
you O
now O
believe O
yourselves O

" O
by O
our O

you O
mean O

we O
did O
indeed O
form O

we O
were O
preparing O

liberate O
our O
ravished O
territory O

This O
is O
the O
wish O

Arab B-NORP
person O

not O
just O
every O
Iraqi B-NORP

For O
this O

land O

its O
people O

you O

up O

the O
whole O

If O

the O

offer O

saved O
my O

the O
fate O

my O

the O
future O

more O

You O
have O
previously O
made O
me O
an O
offered O
before O

through O
your O

that O
I O
say O
the O
weapons O
of O
mass O

were O
smuggled O
to O
Syria B-GPE
, O
and O
you O
said O
that O
the O
price O
was O
my O
release O
. O

I O
refused O
and O
I O
repeat O
the O
refusal O
once O
again O
. O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
I O
do O
not O
want O
a O
refusal O
from O
you O
, O
I O
want O
you O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

We O
are O
currently O
re-evaluating O
our O
positions O
, O
we O
want O
to O
stop O
the O
bloodshed O
on O
both O
sides O
and O
so O
our O
offer O
is O
made O
from O
the O
point O
of O
strength O
and O
not O
from O
the O
point O
of O
weakness O
. O

We O
asked O

make O
a O

Saddam B-PERSON

Are O
you O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON

our O

We O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON
: O
But O
you O

can O
not O
be O
sold O
or O
bought O

Rumsfeld B-PERSON

But O

that O

Saddam B-PERSON

There O
is O
no O

you O
robbed O

We O

whether O
Saddam B-PERSON

Rumsfeld B-PERSON

Your O

Were O

For O

not O

down O

: O
We O

nothing O

You O
were O
a O
danger O
to O
your O
neighbors O

tried O
to O
acquire O

you O
practiced O

over O

so O
it O
was O
natural O
that O
we O
extended O

to O
the O
people O
of O

rid O

did O

I O

I O

believe O
that O

unless O

himself O

the O
important O
thing O
is O
that O

that O

The O

quoted O

as O
saying O
; O
" O

newspaper O
described O
" O
Fadil B-PERSON
" O
as O
a O
valuable O
commander O
to O
this O
squad O
because O
he O

grew O
up O

He O
was O

not O

was O
too O
small O
and O
mine O
was O
big O
, O
it O
could O
make O
his O
parents O
more O
comfortable O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
would O
only O
use O
it O
for O
one B-TIME
morning I-TIME
and O
would O
return O
it O
to O
me O
before O
noon B-TIME
. O

Although O
there O
was O
only O
a O
nodding O
acquaintance O
between O
the O
neighbor O
and O
me O
, O
we O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
apartment O
building O
after O
all O
and O
were O
both O
Chinese B-NORP
. O

So O
I O
discussed O
with O
my O
wife O
back O
home O
and O
lent O
him O
the O
car O
as O
we O
thought O
we O
would O
not O
be O
using O
the O
car O
until O
the B-TIME
same I-TIME
afternoon I-TIME
. O

And O
then O
something O
happened O
... O

At O
1:00pm B-TIME
, O
the O
neighbor O
called O
me O
, O
saying O
he O
took O
his O
parents O
to O
a O
buffet O
and O
would O
probably O
not O
to O
be O
back O
until O
around O
3:00pm B-TIME
. O

I O
of O
course O
agreed O
and O
asked O
them O
not O
to O
rush O
. O

This O
wait O
lasted O
till O
5:30pm B-TIME
, O
when O
the O
neighbor O
told O
me O
in O
a O
half B-CARDINAL
- O
crying O
tone O
that O
there O
was O
an O
accident O
, O
and O
everyone O
else O
was O
intact O
, O
except O
his O
father O
, O
who O
was O
in O
hospital O
for O
fractures O
. O

I O
comforted O
him O
first B-ORDINAL
and O
asked O
my O
friend O
to O
rush O
me O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

My O
neighbor O
showed O
me O
the O
police O
report O
at O
the O
hospital O
, O
which O
indicated O
it O
was O
all O
my O
neighbor O
's O
fault O
. O

He O
clashed O
into O
a O
truck O
going O
straight O
when O
he O
made O
a O
left O
turn O
. O

My O
car O
was O
completely O
damaged O
and O
had O
been O
towed O
away O
. O

I O
forced O
myself O
to O
refrain O
from O
the O
grief O
of O
loosing O
my O
beloved O
car O
-LRB- O
mine O
was O
liability O
- O
only O
coverage O
-RRB- O
and O
asked O
the O
friend O
to O
send O
their O
family O
home O
. O

And O
then O
the O
nightmare O
began O
. O

The B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
my O
neighbor O
called O
me O
, O
saying O
his O
father O
needed O
to O
undergo O
an O
operation O
in O
hospital O
and O
asked O
where O
the O
money O
would O
come O
from O

I O
told O
him O
part O
would O
be O
covered O
by O
my O
car O
insurance O
. O

After O
a O
while O
, O
he O
called O
again O
, O
saying O
the O
operation O
charge O
was O
high O
and O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O
them O
to O
afford O

I O
tried O
my O
best O
to O
comfort O
him O
then O
and O
told O
him O
to O
think O
of O
a O
way O
slowly O

Just O
then O
, O
a O
nearly O
crazy O
voice O
of O
a O
woman O
came O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
, O
saying O
her O
family O
had O
just O
saved O
several B-MONEY
dozen I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
bucks I-MONEY
for O
the O
down O
payment O
of O
a O
house O
; O
where O
would O
they O
live O
afterwards O
if O
they O
spent O
this O
. O

She O
also O
said O
my O
car O
was O
a O
Japanese B-NORP
one O
, O
which O
had O
poor O
safety O
performance O
and O
it O
was O
my O
car O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
car O
accident O
. O

She O
added O
that O
I O
should O
pay O
the O
money O
because O
the O
car O
was O
mine O
. O

I O
hung O
up O
the O
phone O
angrily O
as O
the O
dialog O
could O
not O
go O
on O
. O

My O
wife O
-LSB- O
pw% O
-RSB- O
had O
been O
persuading O
me O
aside O
, O
saying O
some O
women O
would O
easily O
lose O
mind O
once O
in O
fury O
. O

She O
asked O
me O
to O
take O
no O
heed O
of O
them O
and O
let O
them O
calm O
down O
first B-ORDINAL
. O

So O
I O
did O
n't O
take O
their O
words O
seriously O
but O
still O
felt O
angry O
. O

Out O
of O
my O
expectation O
, O
a O
phone O
call O
on O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
day O
completely O
changed O
my O
original O
idea O
. O

The O
telephone O
rang O
just O
as O
I O
was O
about O
to O
go O
to O
work O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
sales O
call O
and O
was O
prepared O
to O
end O
it O
perfunctorily O
. O

Unexpectedly O
, O
coming O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
was O
a O
deep O
and O
resolute O
voice O
of O
a O
middle O
- O
aged O
man O
. O

He O
said O
in O
an O
incontestable O
tone O
that O
my O
neighbor O
had O
a O
car O
accident O
as O
a O
result O
of O
borrowing O
my O
car O
, O
which O
traumatized O
them O
both O
physically O
and O
mentally O
and O
harmed O
their O
economic O
interests O
, O
and O
as O
the O
car O
owner O
, O
they O
would O
not O
sue O
me O
if O
I O
compensated O
them O
for O
the O
hospital O
charge O
and O
the O
costs O
of O
missing O
work O
hours O
-LRB- O
three B-CARDINAL
times O
-RRB- O
, O
otherwise O
they O
would O
see O
me O
in O
court O
. O

He O
added O
that O
he O
was O
certain O
about O
the O
case O
as O
a O
lawyer O
in O
business O
for O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE
and O
the O
compensation O
he O
requested O
could O
double O
in O
court O
. O

As O
a O
great O
Chinese B-NORP
guy O
, O
how O
could O
I O
be O
scared O
by O
a O
few O
remarks O
of O
the O
lawyer O
? O

I O
also O
took O
up O
the O
weapon O
of O
law O
for O
justice O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
also O
retained O
a O
lawyer O
. O

Out O
of O
my O
expectation O
, O
my O
lawyer O
solved O
the O
problem O
by O
merely O
making O
two B-CARDINAL
phone O
calls O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
was O
to O
the O
police O
station O
, O
asking O
for O
any O
additional O
findings O
in O
the O
investigation O
report O
of O
the O
accident O
. O

There O
was O
additional O
findings O
unexpectedly O
, O
which O
were O
against O
them O
. O

Someone O
at O
the O
junk O
yard O
found O
a O
bottle O
of O
unfinished O
wine O
without O
the O
lid O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
reported O
it O
to O
the O
police O
station O
. O

The O
police O
found O
they O
put O
the O
bottle O
of O
unfinished O
wine O
in O
the O
car O
without O
the O
lid O
after O
lunch O
. O

The O
second B-ORDINAL
call O
was O
to O
their O
lawyer O
. O

So O
their O
lawyer O
dropped O
the O
lawsuit O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
they O
would O
not O
stop O
it O
there O
and O
came O
to O
discuss O
with O
me O
several O
times O
, O
sometimes O
honey O
- O
tongued O
and O
sometimes O
threatening O
. O

The O
most O
classic O
one O
was O
: O
Do O
n't O
ever O
dream O
of O
living O
a O
life O
back O
to O
China B-GPE
, O
as O
we O
have O
people O
across O
the O
country O
. O

Disgusting O
! O



Here O
comes O
the O
old O
topic O
again O
, O
are O
you O
going O
to O
lend O
your O
car O
if O
your O
neighbor O
or O
friend O
asks O
. O

I O
think O
many O
people O
will O
say O
they O
wo O
n't O
. O

I O
would O
suggest O
not O
to O
lend O
online O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Internet O
is O
after O
all O
virtual O
. O

Words O
sometimes O
have O
no O
emotions O
. O

When O
your O
seemingly O
nice O
neighbor O
, O
seemingly O
close O
friend O
, O
or O
a O
girl O
whose O
eyes O
can O
speak O
asks O
for O
it O
in O
the O
real O
world O
, O
how O
many O
people O
will O
answer O
with O
a O
" O
no O
? O
" O

Anyhow O
, O
I O
was O
not O
able O
to O
do O
that O
. O

I O
lent O
my O
car O
to O
some O
people O
in O
need O
after O
that O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
there O
are O
not O
many O
people O
like O
my O
former O
neighbor O
couple O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
here O
is O
a O
summery O
of O
the O
loss O
of O

in O
2004 B-DATE
the O

amounted O

only O
10 B-PERCENT

Clearly O

While O
this O
type O

in O
China B-GPE
has O
no O

on O

" O
neither O

If O
this O

it O
will O
be O
working O
against O
the O
original O

. O

Clearly O
the O
necessity O
for O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
needs O
to O
be O
challenged O
. O

I O
propose O
eliminating O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
just O
as O
the O
agricultural O
tax O
was O
eliminated O
, O
to O
give O
people O
an O
opportunity O
to O
prosper O
. O

If O
we O
think O
in O
terms O
of O
humanizing O
the O
system O
, O
i.e. O
, O
helping O
the O
poor O
by O
letting O
poor O
people O
get O
rich O
, O
we O
should O
give O
low O
- O
and O
moderate O
- O
income O
people O
a O
chance O
to O
improve O
and O
raise O
the O
quality O
of O
their O
lives O
; O
the O
threshold O
for O
China B-GPE
's O
personal O
income O
tax O
should O
be O
at O
least O
tripled O
from O
the O
starting O
threshold O
of O
800 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
per O
month O
, O
i.e. O
, O
to O
6400 B-MONEY
yuan I-MONEY
per O
person O
. O

That O
would O
take O
it O
to O
a O
minimally O
humanized O
level O
, O
and O
then O
we O
could O
really O
talk O
about O
" O
people O
first B-ORDINAL
. O
" O

With O
a O
threshold O
below O
this O
level O
, O
the O
poor O
will O
always O
be O
poor O
. O

Yesterday O
CCTV B-ORG
presented O
a O
program O
on O
adjustment O
of O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
, O
emphasized O
that O
the O
main O
goal O
of O
the O
adjustment O
was O
to O
" O
take O
from O
the O
rich O
" O
and O
let O
poor O
people O
get O
wealthy O
. O

If O
we O
really O
want O
to O
give O
poor O
people O
a O
chance O
to O
get O
wealthy O
, O
the O
threshold O
for O
the O
personal O
income O
tax O
should O
be O
tripled O
. O

With O
anything O
under O
this O
threshold O
, O
the O
poor O
will O
have O
no O
chance O
to O
get O
rich O
. O

And O
if O
we O
're O
looking O
at O
it O
in O
terms O
of O
" O
taking O
from O
the O
rich O
, O
" O
the O
problem O
to O
be O
adjusted O
is O
definitely O
not O
whether O
or O
not O
to O
tax O
income O
but O
rather O
the O
problem O
of O
the O
actual O
method O
for O
distributing O
China B-GPE
's O
social O
national O
income O
, O
namely O
how O
to O
eliminate O
the O
" O
unreported O

" O

The O
income O
of O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
China B-GPE

is O
unreported O

In O
China B-GPE
the O
primary O

two B-CARDINAL

I O
can O
imagine O

or O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
problems O
I O
can O
see O
. O

1. B-CARDINAL
The O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
is O
too O
cheap O
. O

In O
an O
absolute O
sense O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
has O
+already O
been O
cheaper O
than O
China B-GPE
's O
, O
and O
in O
a O
relative O
sense O
, O
the O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
is O
even O
cheaper O
. O

In O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
the O
money O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
meal O
at O
McDonald B-ORG

can O
fill O

more O
than O
10 B-QUANTITY

but O
in O

you O
can O
get O
5 B-QUANTITY
- I-QUANTITY
6 I-QUANTITY
liters I-QUANTITY
of O
gas O
at O
most O
. O

The O
US B-GPE
low O
gas O
price O
policy O
has O
undoubtedly O
led O
to O
this O
country O
's O
excessive O
use O
of O
and O
overdependence O
on O
energy O
resources O
. O

However O
, O
there O
is O
more O
to O
this O
matter O
, O
the O
whole O
world O
has O
to O
share O
the O
various O
negative O
effects O
caused O
by O
the O
US B-GPE
excessive O
energy O
consumption O
: O
global O
warming O
, O
and O
wars O
caused O
by O
oil O
, O
etc. O

It O
is O
totally O
a O
joke O
that O
the O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
could O
be O
cheaper O
than O
China B-GPE
's O
. O

2. B-CARDINAL
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
price O
is O
too O
expensive O
. O

Both O
Americans B-NORP
and O
Chinese B-NORP
buy O
gas O
from O
the O
international O
market O
, O
and O
the O
technology O
and O
cost O
of O
oil O
refinement O
are O
not O
too O
much O
different O
. O

But O
with O
the O
US B-GPE
gas O
price O
including O
taxes O
even O
lower O
than O
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
price O
excluding O
taxes O
, O
you O
can O
see O
how O
much O
money O
Chinese B-NORP
oil O
companies O
have O
made O
out O
of O
this O
. O

If O
there O
are O
no O
price O
controls O
and O
monopolies O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
price O
should O
n't O
have O
been O
this O
high O
. O

I O
want O
to O
say O
that O
I O
think O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
opinions O
are O
both O
correct O
. O

So O
, O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
oil O
consumption O
, O
I O
think O
China B-GPE
and O
the O
US B-GPE
, O
the O
No. O
1 B-CARDINAL
and O
No. O
2 B-CARDINAL
oil O
consumers O
in O
the O
world O
, O
are O
also O
a O
funny O
pair O
. O

From O
a O
global O
perspective O
, O
the O
US B-NORP
gas O
price O
is O
obviously O
too O
low O
. O

So O

raising O

prices O
-RRB- O
. O

China B-GPE
's O
gas O
prices O
are O
more O
complicated O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
gas O
prices O
in O
China B-GPE
are O
probably O
not O
very O
high O
, O
but O
in O
order O
to O
reduce O
China B-GPE
's O
future O
overdependence O
on O
gas O
, O
it O
may O
be O
better O
that O
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
prices O
are O
higher O
. O

But O
, O
the O
direct O
result O
of O
the O
gas O
price O
increase O
in O
China B-GPE
will O
be O
the O
increase O
of O
monopoly O
profits O
of O
the O
monopoly O
companies O
. O

This O
part O
of O
money O
will O
not O
become O
the O
government O
tax O
revenue O
, O
will O
not O
be O
used O
for O
public O
welfare O
, O
and O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
will O
only O
make O
the O
benefits O
of O
those O
people O
working O
at O
the O
monopoly O
department O
even O
better O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
gas O
price O
in O
China B-GPE
is O
too O
high O
in O
the O
distributive O
sense O
. O

It O
is O
the O
price O
that O
transfers O
the O
entire O
social O
resources O
to O
a O
very O
small O
number O
of O
people O
. O

But O
in O
terms O
of O
sustainability O
, O
China B-GPE
's O
gas O
price O
may O
still O
be O
too O
low O
. O

We O
need O
high O
gas O
prices O
to O
control O
the O
overdependence O
on O
energy O
imports O
. O

Perhaps O
someone O
will O
condemn O
me O
, O
saying O
further O
increase O
of O
gas O
prices O
will O
make O
life O
unbearable O
for O
people O
. O

If O
you O

my O
reply O

the O
reason O

under O
tremendous O
international O
and O
domestic O
political O
pressures O
on O
planned O
economy O
and O
public O

, O
which O
grew O
into O
today B-DATE

para-system O
after O
about O
30 B-DATE
years I-DATE
of O

opening O

Regarding O
this O
, O
the O
factual O
development O
process O
of O
political O
civilization O
that O
the O
Marxist B-NORP
ideology O
has O
been O
increasingly O
marginalized O
over O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
or O
so O
is O
a O
strong O
evidence O
. O

By O
sorting O
out O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
above O
historical O
background O
and O
conceptual O
relationships O
, O
we O
will O
have O
a O
pretty O
thorough O
, O
comprehensive O
and O
systematic O
knowledge O
framework O
about O
the O
benign O
inevitable O
trends O
and O
development O
guidelines O
of O
the O
future O
society O
dependent O
on O
the O
rule O
of O
society O
, O
so O
that O
the O
associated O
impression O
captured O
may O
be O
more O
concrete O
. O

Regarding O
this O
, O
my O
standpoint O
is O
: O
because O
the O
socialism O
underpinned O
by O
planned O
economy O
, O
public O
ownership O
and O
the O
people O
's O
democratic O
dictatorship O
is O
indeed O
a O
really O
" O
fresh O
" O
systemic O
thing O
for O
China B-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
mid I-DATE
and I-DATE
late I-DATE
20th I-DATE
century I-DATE
-- O
without O
a O
model O
or O
sufficient O
experience O
or O
theories O
to O
refer O
to O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
scientific O
its O
kernel O
is O
, O
it O
is O
hard O
not O
to O
have O
certain O
superficial O
and O
local O
problems O
. O

However O
, O
this O
should O
not O
provide O
an O
excuse O
to O
overthrow O
it O
by O
fair O
means O
or O
foul O
, O
as O
he O
is O
our O
father O
and O
the O
common O
choice O
of O
millions B-CARDINAL
of O
laboring O
people O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
it O
" O
finally O
became O
our O
national O
character O
and O
main O
system O
after O
over O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
century I-DATE
of O
international O
and O
domestic O
political O
transformation O
" O
is O
a O
stronger O
proof O
that O
it O
is O
the O
milestone O
for O
a O
new O
civilization O
resulted O
from O
the O
blood O
and O
sweat O
of O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
proletarian O
revolutionary O
martyrs O
. O



Therefore O
, O
no O
matter O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
average O
citizens O
or O
from O
the O
standpoint O
of O
the O
founder O
of O
the O
new O
government O
, O
we O
should O
respect O
and O
develop O
her O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
inheritance O
, O
innovation O
and O
improvement O
. O

Is O
my O
opinion O
above O
correct O
? O

I O
believe O
you O
will O
naturally O
obtain O
a O
relatively O
fair O
and O
just O
conclusion O
if O
you O
could O
understand O
and O
treat O
the O
above O
- O
mentioned O
" O
father O
" O
system O
and O
" O
son O
" O
system O
with O
impartiality O
and O
sufficient O
goodwill O
. O

For O
example O
, O
based O
on O
the O
existing O
institutional O
cultural O
heritage O
in O
the O
human O
history O
, O
we O
could O
see O
: O
the O
" O
father O
" O
system O
mentioned O
herein O
has O
the O
majority O
in O
mind O
or O
it O
is O
established O
in O
the O
fundamental O
and O
long O
- O
term O
interests O
of O
the O
majority O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
need O
for O
sustainable O
and O
sound O
development O
of O
the O
country O
, O
the O
nation O
, O
and O
the O
overall O
society O
-- O
while O
the O
" O
son O
" O
system O
mentioned O
herein O
is O
ignorant O
and O
sick O
in O
the O
company O
of O
such O
behavioral O
characteristics O
as O
exploitation O
, O
fraudulence O
, O
pernicious O
influence O
and O

. O

So O
, O
we O
can O
not O
urge O
the O
son O
to O
throttle O
the O
essentially O
healthy O
and O
scientific O
" O

" O
system O
by O
fair O
mean O
or O
foul O
without O
considering O
the O
consequences O
, O
because O
there O
are O
problems O
in O
its O
practice O
and O
development O
-- O
such O
as O
state O
monopoly O
for O
purchases O
and O
sales O
, O
lower O
efficiency O
due O
to O

by O

pressure O
resulting O
from O

during O
the O

It O
is O
because O
that O
will O
not O
only O
make O
the O
society O
increasingly O
ignorant O
and O
sick O
as O
it O
violates O
the O
rule O
of O

, O
distorts O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
the O
case O
. O

My O
opinion O
above O
is O
not O
absurd O

at O

A B-DATE
month I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
I O
was O
really O
desperate O
, O
I O
lost O
my O
current O
job O
, O
which O
I O
was O
completely O
unprepared O
for O
, O
and O
had O
to O
find O
a O
job O
within O
a B-DATE
month I-DATE
to O
keep O
myself O
going O
. O

Now O
in O
this B-DATE
month I-DATE
with O
the O
Christmas B-EVENT
holiday O
there O
's O
really O
only O
three B-DATE
weeks I-DATE
of O
actual O
work O
time O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
any O
companies O
are O
going O
to O
be O
hiring O
people O
during O
this O
period O
. O

Despair O
, O
that O
sinking O
feeling O
weighing O
on O
my O
mind O
, O
so O
much O
pressure O
I O
could O
n't O
eat O
, O
could O
n't O
sleep O
; O
I O
was O
simply O
going O
crazy O
. O

But O
I O
still O
needed O
to O
do O
something O
; O
getting O
crazy O
- O
hysteric O
makes O
no O
sense O
. O

Then O
I O
started O
connecting O
with O
my O
friends O
in O
America B-GPE
; O
I O
went O
to O
Maimaiti B-PERSON
to O
ask O
for O
help O
, O
consulted O
about O
my O
status O
, O
and O
looked O
for O
a O
way O
to O
solve O
the O
problem O
. O

Even O
my O
relatives O
' O
friends O
in O
America B-GPE
and O
my O
parents O
' O
friends O
all O
got O
involved O
. O

Friends O
, O
it O
's O
always O
friends O
who O
help O
me O
at O
key O
moments O
. O

Many O
friends O
got O
people O
they O
knew O
to O
recommend O
me O
, O
help O
me O
send O
out O
resumes O
, O
or O
call O
and O
commiserate O
with O
me O
. O

There O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
friend O
who O
had O
just O
got O
an O
offer O
, O
but O
he O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
go O
, O
so O
he O
recommended O
me O
to O
go O
for O
him O
, O
but O
it O
was O
way O
off O
in O
LA B-GPE
, O
plus O
the O
salary O
was O
n't O
ideal O
, O
but O
at O
least O
it O
could O
help O
me O
keep O
the O
legal O
status O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
take O
it O
. O

After O
the O
telephone O
interview O
, O
I O
flew O
to O
LA B-GPE
, O
landing O
at O
12:00 B-TIME
noon I-TIME
, O
and O
at O
4:00 B-TIME
p.m. I-TIME
. O

I O
had O
the O
interview O
. O

By O
then O
17 B-TIME
- I-TIME
18 I-TIME
hours I-TIME
had O
passed O
since O
I O
'd O
gotten O
up O
at O
4:00 B-TIME
a.m. I-TIME

Although O
I O
was O
too O
tired O
to O
walk O
, O
I O
still O
had O
to O
pump O
up O
my O
spirits O
so O
I O
'd O
be O
in O
peak O
form O
for O
the O
interview O
. O

The O
interview O
did O
n't O
last O
long O
, O
just O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
and O
it O
was O
over O
. O

I O
felt O
the O
interview O
went O
well O
, O
and O
started O
to O
feel O
confident O
. O

But O
on O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
one B-CARDINAL
senior O
level O
person O
was O
n't O
there O
, O
so O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
day I-DATE
early O
I O
had O
to O
go O
back O
to O
talk O
to O
him O
. O

So O
the O
next O
day O
I O
got O
up O
at O
7:00 B-TIME
and O
ran O
over O
to O
chat O
for O
an B-TIME
hour I-TIME
; O
that O
guy O
was O
nice O
, O
did O
n't O
embarrass O

easy O
for O

that O
I O

all O

the O
HR O

would O
return O

I O
went O
straight O

I O
filled O
out O

Finally O

more O

the O

there O

something O

meeting O
strange O

this O

definitely O
fit O

He O
was O
muscle O
for O
a O
Pittsburgh B-GPE
madam O

Tex B-PERSON
Gill I-PERSON

ran O

one B-CARDINAL
night O
, O
we O
're O
at O
his O
apartment O
, O
drunk O
out O
of O
our O
minds O

& O
my O
buddy O
passes O
out O
. O

I O
continue O
drinking O

At O
one B-CARDINAL
point O
, O
I O
glance O
at O
this O
older O
guy O
, O

& O
he O
is O
staring O
at O
my O
buddy O
as O
a O
line O
of O
drool O
runs O
down O
the O
cigarette O
in O

drips O
on O

I O
think O

' O
What O
the O
fuck O
? O
' O

but O
I O
'm O
pretty O
goddamn O
wasted O

& O
reality O
is O
having O
a O
helluva O
time O
penetrating O
the O
fog O
in O
my O
head O
. O

He O
notices O
that O
I O
'm O
kind O
of O
staring O
at O
him O
. O

He O
stands O
up O
, O
walks O
into O
the O
bedroom O
, O
& O
comes O
back O
with O
a O
porno O
mag O
. O

He O
drops O
it O
on O
the O
couch O
next O
to O
me O
. O

As O
he O
's O
sitting O
down O
, O
he O
says O
, O
`` O
See O
anything O
you O
like O
? O
'' O

& O
then O
he O
shoves O
his O
hand O
hard O
into O
my O
groin O
..... O

.... O
& O
I O
broke O
his O
nose O
with O
my O
elbow O
. O

Make O
no O
mistake O
though O
, O
up O
till O
that O
point O
, O
the O
guy O
scared O
the O
shit O
out O
of O
me O
. O

But O
, O
lucky O
for O
me O
, O
my O
reaction O
was O
see O
red O
anger O
instead O
of O
cowering O
fear O
. O

After O
i O
hit O
him O
, O
I O
jumped O
up O
, O
ran O
into O
his O
kitchen O
& O
grabbed O
a O
big O
old O
butcher O
knife O
, O
ran O
back O
into O
the O
room O
& O
proceeded O
to O
kick O
my O
buddy O
into O
consciousness O
& O
drag O
his O
comatose O
ass O
the O
hell O
out O
of O
there O

Now O
, O
for O
me O
, O
the O
interesting O
part O
happened O
years O
later O
. O

At O
the O
time O
, O
my O
buddy O
& O
I O
were O
selling O
things O
. O

My O
buddy O
had O
a O
real O
good O
supplier O
for O
these O
things O
but O
it O
was O
his O
secret O
. O

At O
one O
point O
, O
my O
buddy O
could O
n't O
pick O
up O
the O
shipment O
so O
I O
had O
to O
go O
. O

Before O
I O
left O
, O
he O
had O
to O
explain O
to O
me O
that O
his O
supplier O
was O
none O
other O
than O
Freddie O
Feelup O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
go O
. O

He O
was O
now O
closer O
to O
40 B-CARDINAL

just O
a O
hollow O
shell O
of O
his O
former O
self O

Friendless O
, O
his O
only O
company O
being O

looking O

kept O
one B-CARDINAL

empty O
except O
for O
4 B-CARDINAL
black O
candles O
in O
each O
of O
its O
corners O
. O

he O
would O
read O
curses O
aimed O
at O
people O
who O
pissed O
him O
off O

beat O
him O

My O
question O
is O
, O
when O
is O
a O
victim O
guilty O
of O
abuse O
? O

Jackson B-PERSON
is O
definitely O
a O
mind O
- O
control O
, O
SRA O
victim O
. O

He O
's O
programmed O
. O

Neverland B-FAC
sounds O
like O
a O
cryptic O
command O
from O
MKULTRA O
Wizard O
of O
Oz O
programming O
. O

The O
bizarre O
from O
black O
- O
to O
- O
white O
and O
physical O
transformation O
must O
be O
the O
result O
of O
biotech O
advances O
. O

If O
he O
does O
abuse O
' O
his O
' O
children O
, O
is O
he O
' O
guilty O
' O
as O
such O
if O
he O
is O
programmed O
? O

I O
suspect O
he O
is O
a O
brilliant O
cover O
or O
red O
- O
herring O
used O
as O
a O
shield O
by O
very O
powerful O
forces O
, O
responsible O
for O
God O
- O
knows O
- O
what O
at O
his O
now O
- O
abandoned O
ranch O
. O

It O
's O
very O
effective O
, O
as O
many O
' O
feel O
' O
that O
whilst O
MJ B-PERSON
is O
naive O
he O
's O
not O
capable O
of O
the O
evil O
associated O
with O
pedophile O
activity O
. O

This O
may O
not O
be O
the O
case O
, O
as O
the O
public O
' O
persona O
' O
is O
merely O
an O
' O
alter O
' O
personality O
and O
he O
may O
have O
many O
other O
' O
personalities O
' O
which O
are O
dark O
. O

Then O
comes O
the O
question O
whether O
his O
programmers O
were O
programmed O
themselves O
. O

If O
so O
, O
then O
they O
are O
all O
guilty O
of O
such O
abuse O
, O
whilst O
being O
innocent O
at O
the O
same O
time O
! O



As O
most O
abuse O
is O
generational O
, O
the O
whole O
mind O
- O
control O
subject O
really O
has O
to O
be O
brought O
out O
in O
the O
open O
. O

The O
very O
technology O
and O
tools O
used O
on O
the O
mind O
which O
harm O
can O
then O
be O
used O
to O
heal O
. O

Brr O

I O
remember O
being O
spooked O
by O
that O

their O

they O

' O
. O

They O
said O
all O
they O
knew O
was O
that O
his O
mother O
-LRB- O
who O
apparently O
is O
still O
a O

took O
him O

The O

apparently O
had O
little O

no O

at O
all O
. O

As O
for O
the O
child O
abuse O
, O
I O
have O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
post O
above O
, O
you O
can O
find O
abuse O
and O
' O
sick O
' O
individuals O
in O
ANY O
organization O
, O

but O
you O
have O
too O
look O
at O
the O
proportion O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
society O
. O

One B-CARDINAL
of O
my O
friends O
is O
an O
' O
elder O
' O
-LRB- O
soething O
like O
a O
' O
local O
church O
leader O
' O
-RRB- O
, O

but O
he O
also O
said O
their O
instructions O
say O
that O
if O
they O
hear O
of O
any O
abuse O
they O
are O
to O
follow O
local O
laws O
, O
which O
usually O
requires O
them O
to O
inform O
the O
police O
ASAP O
. O

And O
if O
the O
abuse O
is O
at O
all O
serious O
to O
report O
it O
to O
the O
police O
regardless O
. O

Though O
i O
do O
n't O
agree O
with O
all O

beliefs O
, O
I O
know O
these O
guys O
well O
enough O
to O
call O
them O
friends O
. O

So O
in O
their O
respect O
, O
after O
reading O
some O
of O
the O
other O
comments O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
listen O
to O
their O
side O
before O
passing O
judgement O
. O

We O
should O
ALL O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
pass O
judgement O
on O
ENTIRE O
groups O
of O
people O
based O
on O
the O
apparent O
actions O
of O

. O

That O
is O
what O
Hitler B-PERSON
tried O

do O
. O

With O

like O
that O
, O
even O
if O
we O
got O
rid O

the O
evil O

, O
a O

would O
rise O

That O
seems O

We O
have O
all O

had O
long O

I O
was O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
in O
the O
previous O

that O
really O
all O

the O

the O
drive O
for O

, O
all O
that O
propaganda O
, O
was O
essentially O
nonsensical O
because O
in O
1990 B-DATE
, O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
made O
the O
only O
self O
criticism O
. O

He O
said O
, O
I O
could O
either O
invade O
Kuwait B-GPE
or O
finish O
developing O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
. O

Maybe O
before O
the O
weapon O
and O
then O
later O
he O
said O
, O
Oh O
, O
I O
should O
have O
got O
the O
nuclear O
weapon O
before O
I O
invaded O
. O

He O
was O
right O
about O
that O
, O
but O
that O
means O
that O
he O
inaugurated O
at O
that O
point O
like O
a O
dozen B-DATE

years I-DATE

all O
we O

to O
do O
with O

that O

finished O
in O
`91 B-DATE
when O
it O
could O
have O
been O
finished O
. O

Should O
have O
taken O
the O
side O
of O
the O
rebels O
then O
, O
taken O
the O
risk O
of O
supporting O
a O
Shiite B-NORP
insurrection O
at O
that O
point O
, O
helping O
the O
Kurds B-NORP
, O
removing O
the O

. O

Absolutely O
. O

We O
'd O
be O
11 B-DATE
years I-DATE
into O
nation O
building O
by O
now O
if O
we O
'd O
done O
that O
. O

That O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
core O
of O
the O
argument O

As O
you O
point O
out O
, O

course O
, O
for O
the O
fact O

matter O

mistakes O

, O
again O

you O
point O
out O
, O
Norman B-PERSON
Schwarzkopf I-PERSON
making O
a O
peace O

permitting O
helicopters O

fly O

Still O
hurts O
me O
to O
read O
this O
. O

The O
little O
town O
I O
was O
in O
this O
southern O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
got O
, O
I O
ca O
n't O
boast O
of O
further O
, O
is O
where O
the O
talks O
took O
place O
. O

We O
have O
the O
transcript O
of O
the O
meeting O
. O

They O
say O
, O
Okay O
, O
we O
have O
lost O
this O
round O
, O
Do O
you O
mind O
if O
we O
keep O
your O
helicopters O
in O
the O
air O
just O
to O
be O
able O
to O
transport O
things O

and O
he O
says O
, O
Yeah O
, O
that O
's O
all O
right O
. O

They O
ask O
again O
, O
Are O
you O
sure O
they O
mean O
that O
? O

They O
ca O
n't O
believe O
the O
luck O
. O

They O
use O
the O
gunships O
to O
kill O
, O
we O
think O
, O
not B-CARDINAL
less I-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
50,000 I-CARDINAL
inhabitants O
of O
southern O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
trying O
to O
do O
that O
to O
the O
Kurds B-NORP
, O
as O
well O
, O
so O
it O
was O
a O
knife O
edge O

And O
it O
's O
not O
just O
being O
wise O
after O
the O
event O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
to O
say O
that O
there O
was O
an O
argument O
in O
realtime O
between O
the O
Bush B-PERSON
administration O
members O
. O

Mr. O
Cheney B-PERSON
's O
the O
only O
one O
I O
know O
that O
changed O
his O
mind O
. O

Most O
of O
those O
that O
took O
the O
view O
at O
that O
time O
, O
think O
until O
recently O
they O
were O
correct O
in O
saving O
Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
. O

Of O
course O
, O
Mr. O
Cheney B-PERSON
was O
in O
the O
chain O
of O
command O
with O
Swartzkopf B-PERSON
and O
-- O

Many O
others O
. O

When O
they O
made O
the O
decision O
not O
to O
move O
toward O
Bagdad B-GPE
with O
bad O
information O
, O
namely O

, O
well O
, O
we O
know O
now O
the O
harvest O
of O
all O
that O
. O

It O
hurts O
to O
think O
of O
how O
many O
wonderful O
people O
in O
Iraq B-GPE

alive O

been O
horribly O
murdered O

tortured O

reduced O

now O
we O
have O
an O
opportunity O

why O

our O
New B-GPE

writer O
for O

. O

and O
Dan B-PERSON
, O

did O
consider O
herself O
sort O
of O
the O
Republican B-NORP
environmentalist O
, O
but O
now O
there O
's O
been O
an O
awful O
lot O
of O
Monday B-TIME
night I-TIME
quarterback O
quarterbacking O
taking O
place O
now O
that O
she O
's O
stepped O
down O
. O

What O
do O
you O
suppose O
took O
place O
here O
? O

I O
think O
many O
people O
have O
watched O
this O

in O
action O
and O
watched O
Christy B-PERSON
Whitman I-PERSON
in O
action O
. O

The O
mystery O
is O
that O
she O
took O
the O
job O
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
or O
did O
n't O
leave O
earlier O
. O

She O
was O
quite O
a O
misfit O
for O
this O
administration O
, O
and O
she O
showed O
that O
over O
and O
over O
. O

She O
was O
not O
good O
at O
all O
at O
communicating O
the O
administration O
's O
message O
to O
the O
public O
and O
certainly O
to O
the O
environmental O
groups O
and O
she O
was O
even O
worse O
at O
bringing O
the O
EPA B-ORG
bureaucracy O
, O
the O
EPA B-ORG
environmental O
policy O
makers O
' O
message O
to O
this O
administration O
because O
she O
saw O
herself O
undercut O
over O
and O
over O
. O

That O
's O
interesting O
because O
leading O
into O
it O
, O
while O
she O
was O
New B-GPE
Jersey I-GPE
governor O
, O
she O
sued O
the O
EPA B-ORG
and O
she O
was O
very O
much O
considering O
herself O
to O
be O
an O
environmentalist O
, O
and O
then O
only O
to O
end O
up O
becoming O
the O
head O
of O
the O
EPA B-ORG
and O
then O
of O
course O
, O
there O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
criticism O
over O
relaxed O
regulations O
. O

Let O
's O
hear O
what O
she O
had O
to O
say O
last B-DATE
Wednesday I-DATE
here O
on O
CNN O
just O
after O
announcing O
her O
resignation O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
leaving O
because O
of O
clashes O
with O
the O
administration O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
had O
any O
. O

I O
report O
to O
the O
President O
, O
and O
he O
has O
always O
asked O
me O
to O
give O
him O
my O
best O
unadulterated O
advice O
. O

We O
have O
have O
been O
on O
the O
same O
page O
. O

I O
was O
never O
supportive O
of O
protocol O
because O
it O
did O
n't O
do O
what O
everyone O
needs O
to O
get O
done O
as O
far O
as O
climate O
change O
is O
concerned O
. O

I O
'm O
leaving O
now O
because O
it O
's O
the O
appropriate O
time O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Dan O
, O
do O
you O
agree O
with O
that O
? O

She O
says O
the O
appropriate O
time O
. O

Do O
you O
suppose O
for O
personal O
reasons O
or O
perhaps O
she O
was O
out O
of O
step O
with O
the O
administration O
? O

I O
'm O
sure O
that O
it O
was O
difficult O
for O
her O
personally O
, O
but O
I O
think O
the O
commuter O
marriage O
perhaps O
would O
have O
been O
less O
stressful O
if O
everyday O
she O
did O
n't O
see O
herself O
being O
undermined O
and O
overruled O
. O

I O
mean O
if O
Christy B-PERSON
Whitman I-PERSON
and O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House I-ORG
were O
on O
the O
same O

, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
've O
seen O
a O
book O
large O
enough O
to O
contain O
a O
page O
that O
big O
. O

Over O
and O

were O
many O

many O

United I-ORG

's O
very O

no O

very O
well O

I O

the O
point O

clearly O
a O
very O

MR. O

it O

good O

you O
here O

Nice O
to O
be O
here O
, O
Lou B-PERSON
. O

Let O
's O
start O
with O
that O
surprise O
, O
the O
malfeasance O
that O
is O
crossing O
your O
desk O
. O

Are O
you O
suggesting O
corporate O
America B-GPE
has O
not O
learned O
its O
lesson O
yet O
? O

Well O
, O
no O
. O

I O
think O
that O
quote O
is O
a O
little O
out O
of O
context O
there O
. O

there O
are O
15,000 B-CARDINAL
companies O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
and O
I O
think O
the O
great O
bulk O
of O
them O
are O
very O
honestly O
managed O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

a O
number O
of O
people O
have O
had O
egregious O
fraud O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

There O
's O
been O
a O
general O
loosening O
of O
morals O
across O
the O
board O
. O

What O
I O
was O
referring O
to O
in O
that O
quote O
you O
had O
was O
the O
number O
of O
cases O
we O
see O
day O
in O
and O
day O
out O
at O
the O
lowest O
levels O
, O
scams O
and O
so O
forth O
, O
where O
considerable O
amounts O
of O
money O
are O
being O
made O
and O
lost O
by O
relatively O
small O
investors O
. O

Is O
the O
investor O
today B-DATE
in O
your O
judgment O
secure O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
marketplace O
is O
becoming O
increasingly O
secure O
. O

I O
think O
a O
number O
of O
the O
reforms O
that O
have O
come O
via O
the B-LAW
Sarbanes I-LAW
- I-LAW
Oxley I-LAW
Act I-LAW
and O
a O
number O
of O
things O
that O
we O
have O
done O
at O
the O
SEC B-ORG
are O
basically O
making O
everybody O
take O
a O
new O
look O
at O
how O
they O
're O
performing O
their O
duty O
as O
a O
director O
, O
how O
they O
're O
performing O
their O
duties O
on O
audit O
committees O
and O
compensation O
committees O
and O
in O
Wall B-ORG
Street I-ORG
. O

I O
think O
the O
reforms O
that O
came O
as O
a O
part O
of O
the O
large O
settlement O
are O
going O
to O
change O
the O
way O
research O
and O
investment O
banking O
are O
done O
to O
the O
betterment O
of O
the O
individual O
investor O
. O

And O
some O
people O
are O
surprised O
and O
I O
might O
even O
add O
pleased O
in O
this O
city O
that O
your O
SEC B-ORG
has O
been O
quick O
to O
react O
when O
Phil B-PERSON
Purcell I-PERSON
of O
Morgan B-ORG
Stanley I-ORG
made O
a O
statement O
that O
your O
SEC B-ORG
did O
n't O
think O
and O
that O
you O
did O
n't O
think O
expressed O
appropriate O
contrition O
when O
Bear B-ORG
Stearns I-ORG
stepped O
out O
of O
line O
in O
the O
view O
of O
the O
SEC B-ORG
. O

It O
was O
n't O
a O
polite O
phone O
call O
quietly O
made O
, O
either O
from O
your O
enforcement O
division O
or O
from O
your O
office O
, O
it O
was O
rather O
public O
. O

Is O
that O
the O
way O
you O
're O
going O
to O
operate O
? O

Well O
, O
Lou B-PERSON
, O
we O
're O
deadly O
serious O
about O
bringing O
reform O
into O
the O
marketplace O
. O

We O
're O
deadly O
serious O
about O
some O
of O
the O
actions O
we O
've O
taken O
, O
and O
when O
we O
see O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
appear O
to O
be O
taking O
it O
too O
seriously O
, O
we O
're O
going O
to O
get O
to O
them O
right O
away O
. O

And O
I O
think O
perhaps O
no O
one O
more O
surprised O
than O
some O
of O
the O
people O
running O
those O
firms O
on O
Wall B-FAC
Street I-FAC
. O

You O
have O
also O
expressed O
concern O
about O
excessive O
executive O
compensation O
, O
particularly O
CEO O
compensation O
. O

Is O
there O
really O
anything O
that O
can O
be O
done O
about O
this O
problem O
? O

I O
think O
so O
, O
Lou B-PERSON
. O

I O
think O
the O
real O
next O
step O
here O
is O
for O
compensation O
committees O
to O
spend O
a O
little O
more O
time O
than O
they O
do O
on O
what O
they O
're O
really O
compensating O
for O
. O

I O
think O
there O
's O
been O
too O
much O
emphasis O
on O
performance O
defined O
strictly O
by O
stock O
performance O
and O
earnings O
per O
share O
. O

I O
think O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
other O
measures O
that O
indicate O
how O
well O
somebody O
's O
doing O
running O
a O
company O
, O
and O
I O
think O

acceptance O

improvizational O

, O
despite O
whatever O
region O

. O

It O
's O
about O
the O

the O

sold O
out O

16 B-DATE

I O
mean O
, O
the O
amazing O
thing O
is O
, O
we O
used O
no O
traditional O
advertising O
. O

We O
put O
all O
these O
bands O
together O
. O

It O
draws O
a O
huge O
audience O
, O
so O
the O
record O
companies O
and O
the O
music O
business O
has O
to O
take O
all O
of O
these O

more O
seriously O
. O

It O
's O

in O
numbers O
. O

I O
hope O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
can O
happen O
in O
America B-GPE
, O
instead O
of O
it O

It O
very O

although O
, O
I O
must O
say O
that O
the O
Gore B-PERSON
campaign O
has O
been O
somewhat O
disappointed O
by O
the O
number O
of O

they O
have O
not O
received O
thus O
far O
in O
the O

that O

Brian B-PERSON
, O
but O
a O
lot O

still O
must O

We O
are O
also O

Keep O
in O
mind O
, O
those O

When O

Yubitrich B-PERSON
is O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
Belgrade B-GPE

most O

he O
owes O
it O
to O
his O
skilful O
portrayal O

Getting O

quite O

I O
always O
felt O

being O

something O

This O
connection O
to O

out O

15,000 I-QUANTITY

mostly O
on O
foot O
, O
which O
he O
takes O
through O
southwestern O

He O
had O
survived O
, O
if O
you O

a O

now O
in O
that O
new O
freedom O
of O
the O
life O
in O
front O
of O
him O
, O
he O
takes O
to O
the O
road O
in O
the O
tradition O
of O
old O
Chinese B-NORP
poets O

records O
what O

what O
he O
hears O

the O
stories O
that O
he O
is O
told O

The O
book O
is O
filled O
with O
marvelous O
descriptions O
of O
the O
gorges O
through O
which O
he O
walks O
, O
the O
mountains O
that O
he O
climbs O
, O
indeed O
the O
book O
is O
called O
Soul B-WORK_OF_ART
Mountain I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
the O
mountain O
on O
which O
he O
hopes O
in O
some O
way O
or O
another O
to O
get O
in O
touch O
with O
his O
soul O
, O
his O
individual O
soul O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
that O
mass O
kind O
of O
soul O
being O
enforced O
upon O
him O
by O
the O
Communist B-NORP
Chinese B-NORP
authorities O
, O
the O
social O
realism O
that O
the O

would O
have O
him O
write O

Not O
only O
can O
this O
fellow O
write O
, O
he O
can O
paint O
too O
, O
ca O
n't O
he O
? O

He O
is O
best O
known O
among O
his O
neighbors O
in O
Paris B-GPE
as O
a O
painter O
. O

He O
has O
had O
more O
than O
30 B-CARDINAL
one B-CARDINAL
- O
man O
shows O
and O
his O
paintings O
are O
quite O
delicately O
done O
and O
there O
he O
is O
also O
very O
well O
known O
as O
a O
playwright O
. O

I O
think O
he O
has O
published O
about B-CARDINAL
18 I-CARDINAL
plays O
now O
and O
he O
writes O
his O
plays O
in O
French B-LANGUAGE
. O

Just O
one B-CARDINAL
last O
thing O
quoting O
him O
and O
I O
wonder O
if O
you O
could O
respond O
to O
this O
, O
Christopher B-PERSON
, O
he O
said O
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
his O
wonderful O
speech O
to O
the B-ORG
Nobel I-ORG
Prize I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
, O
he O
said O
, O
`` O
I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
waste O
this O
talk O
on O
literature O
by O
saying O
too O
much O
about O
politics O

history O
, O
What O
I O
want O
to O
do O
is O
to O
use O
this O
opportunity O
to O
speak O
as O

writer O
in O
the O
voice O

only O
for O
him O

of O
all O

his O

Well O
, O
the O
work O
that O
we O
have O
so O
far O
in O
English B-LANGUAGE

suggests O
that O
, O
and O
indeed O
this O

is O
a O
celebration O
as O
well O
of O
the O
self O

the O

goes O
so O
far O

even O
divide O
up O

Characters O
proliferate O

almost O
all O

- I-GPE
Sheikh I-GPE
two B-DATE

Arab B-NORP

are O
under O
pressure O

own O
citizens O

take O
a O

James B-PERSON
Drummond I-PERSON
, O
covering O
the O
Arab B-NORP
summit O
in O
Cairo B-GPE
for O
the B-ORG
Financial I-ORG
Times I-ORG
. O

James B-PERSON
, O
there O
's O
a O
reason O
why O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
wanted O
this O
pre-summit O
meeting O
. O

What O
is O
the O
pressure O
on O
them O
prior O
to O
the O
summit O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
they O
want O
to O
try O
and O
iron O
out O
any O
potential O
difficulties O
before O
the O
heads O
of O
state O
come O
into O
town O
on O
Saturday B-DATE
and O
Sunday B-DATE
. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
preparatory O
exercise O
to O
reach O
some O
sort O
of O
agreement O
beforehand O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
not O
all O
Arab B-NORP
states O
are O
speaking O
again O
with O
one B-CARDINAL
voice O
. O

What O
do O
they O
hope O
to O
achieve O
? O
and O
what O
can O
you O
claim O
from O
the O
statements O
made O
today B-DATE
? O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
say O
, O
Arab B-NORP
's O
summit O
have O
traditionally O
been O
exercises O
in O
division O
. O

We O
have O
already O
seen O
problems O
from O
Libyan B-NORP
leader O
Muammar B-PERSON
Gaddafi I-PERSON
on O
Tuesday B-DATE
who O
appeared O
on O
Al B-ORG
- I-ORG
Jazeera I-ORG
, O
the O
pan-Arab B-NORP
satellite O
channel O
, O
and O
, O
rubbish O
, O
what O
he O
said O
was O
a O
draft O
statement O
for O
the O
end O
of O
the O
summit O
on O
Sunday B-DATE
. O

And O
he O
was O
very O
categorical O
that O
it O
was O
too O
weak O
and O
did O
not O
harm O
Israeli B-NORP
interests O
sufficiently O
. O

So O
we O
have O
Gadafi B-PERSON
on O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
hand O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
we O
have O
Egypt B-GPE
which O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
Arab B-NORP
country O
to O
make O
peace O
with O
the O
Jewish B-NORP
state O
, O
which O
is O
of O
course O
also O
a O
top O
recipient O
of O
US B-GPE
aid O
. O

The O
Egyptian B-NORP
President O
Hosni B-PERSON
Mubarak I-PERSON
is O
more O
of O
a O
voice O
of O
moderation O
against O
the O
other O
side O
. O

Tell O
us O
about O
what O
he O
has O
been O
saying O
. O

Well O
, O
Mr. O
Mubarak B-PERSON
has O
been O
, O
as O
you O
say O
, O
a O
voice O
of O
moderation O
. O

He O
has O
invested O
an O
awful O
amount O
in O
the O
peace O
with O
Israel B-GPE
, O
and O
really O
he O
can O
not O
afford O
to O
let O
it O
fail O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
some O
more O
power O
techniques O
perhaps O
from O
his O
Foreign O
Minister O
Amre B-PERSON
Moussa I-PERSON
over O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
, O
but O
Amre B-PERSON
Moussa I-PERSON
today B-DATE
at O
the O
Foreign O
Minister O
's O
meeting O
was O
calling O
simply O
for O
the O
return O
of O
East B-GPE
Jerusalem I-GPE
to O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
, O
in O
stark O
contrast O
to O
Syrian B-NORP
Foreign O
Minister O
Faruq B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Shara I-PERSON
who O
was O
pulling O
for O
a O
complete O
cut O
in O
diplomatic O
relations O
between O
Israel B-GPE
and O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
Arab B-NORP
states O
that O
happen O
. O

So O
Egypt B-GPE
is O
playing O
a O
calming O
role O
. O

It O
will O
not O
want O
to O
see O
anything O
too O
strong O
coming O
out O
of O
this O
summit O
due O
to O
end O
on O
Sunday B-DATE
. O

What O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
prevailing O
voices O
at O
this O
point O
? O

There O
are O
certainly O
calls O
for O
war O
against O
Israel B-GPE
. O

Is O
there O
much O
support O
for O
that O
? O

Well O
, O
actually O
President O
Mubarak B-PERSON
was O
very O
categorical O
today B-DATE
in O
condemning O
calls O
for O
war O
, O
which O
he O
said O
were O
very O
serious O
and O
people O
should O
understand O
the O
implications O
of O
just O
what O
it O
meant O
. O

Egypt B-GPE
and O
Jordan B-GPE
do O
not O
want O
to O
see O
any O
sort O
of O
conventional O
war O
against O
Israel B-GPE
. O

They O
have O
both O
invested O
enormous O
amounts O
in O
it O
, O
and O
both O
regimes O
would O
be O
more O
vulnerable O
if O
the O
peace O
process O
were O
to O
fail O
, O
because O
detractors O
and O
opponents O
within O
each O
country O
would O
have O
ammunition O
by O
which O
to O
fire O
at O
them O
. O

How O
much O
is O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
entering O
into O
the O
conversation O
and O
how O
much O
pressure O
seems O
to O
be O
coming O
from O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
? O

Well O
today O
not O
too O
much O
. O

I O
mean O
Madeleine B-PERSON
Albright I-PERSON
was O
in O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia I-GPE
yesterday B-DATE
where O

unfortunately O

tragically O
got O

up O

that O
seems O
to O
be O
the O

if O

out O

Hoffman B-PERSON

dangerous O

Maritime O

actually O
quite O
rare O

That O
being O

it O
could O
well O
be O
the O
beginning O

We O

it O

using O
their O
more O
conventional O

Yakie I-PERSON
spoke O
with O
our O
New B-GPE
Delhi I-GPE
correspondent O
Jim B-PERSON
Teeple I-PERSON
about O
the O
Russian B-NORP
leader O
's O
visit O
and O
his O
comments O
about O
the O
situation O
in O
the O
disputed O
Kashmir B-GPE
region O
. O

He O
said O
exactly O
what O
the O
Indians B-NORP
wanted O
to O
hear O
, O
which O
is O
that O
the O
dispute O
over O
Kashmir B-GPE
between O
India B-GPE
and O
Pakistan B-GPE
should O
be O
solved O
bilaterally O
and O
that O
there O
should O
be O
no O
outside O
interference O
, O
as O
he O
put O
it O
in O
this O
question O
. O

Now O
this O
is O
something O
the O
Indians O
have O
been O
saying O
all O
along O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
Pakistan B-GPE
wants O
international O
attention O
focussed O
on O
Kashmir B-GPE
, O
and O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
also O
said O
that O
he O
supports O
India B-GPE
's O
tough O
approach O
to O
the O
external O
violence O
in O
Kashmir B-GPE
as O
he O
described O
it O
. O

This O
is O
another O
thing O
that O
the O
Indians B-NORP
were O
glad O
to O
hear O
him O
say O
, O
and O
he O
also O
said O
that O
both O
India B-GPE
and O
Russia B-GPE
suffer O
from O
the O
same O
sort O
of O
terrorism O
, O
as O
he O
put O
it O
, O
referring O
of O
course O
to O
the O
separatist O
militancies O
in O
Chechnya B-GPE
and O
Russia B-GPE
and O
in O
Jammu B-GPE
and O
Kashmir B-GPE
. O

So O
on O
balance O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
that O
the O
Indians B-NORP
heard O
anything O
from O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
that O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
hear O
. O

What O
sort O
of O
hold O
does O
Russia B-GPE
have O
on O
India B-GPE
and O
Pakistan B-GPE
? O

Russia B-GPE
has O
very O
little O
influence O
with O
Pakistan B-GPE
, O
but O
of O
course O
Russia B-GPE
supplies O
India B-GPE
with O
70 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
its O
military O
hardware O
and O
that O
was O
of O
course O
the O
second O
pillar O
here O
of O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
, O
which O
was O
to O
finalize O
some O
very O
substantial O
arms O
deals O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
're O
hearing O
that O
those O
deals O
have O
now O
been O
finalized O
, O
that O
Russia B-GPE
will O
sell O
India B-GPE
300 B-CARDINAL
tanks O
, O
T B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
90 I-PRODUCT
tanks O
, O
very O
advanced O
tanks O
, O
that O
Russia B-GPE
will O
also O
sell O
to O
India B-GPE
some O
Sukoi B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
30 I-PRODUCT
bombers O
, O
fighter O
- O
bombers O
. O

They O
are O
going O
to O
allow O
India B-GPE
to O
assemble O
about B-CARDINAL
140 I-CARDINAL
of O
these O
bombers O
here O
in O
India B-GPE
, O
and O
they O
are O
also O
going O
to O
finalize O
a O
deal O
whereby O
India B-GPE
will O
acquire O
the O
Admiral O
Gorshkov B-PERSON
. O

That O
's O
an O
old O
Russian B-NORP
aircraft O
carrier O
that O
India B-GPE
has O
wanted O
to O
get O
for O
some O
time O
because O
India B-GPE
only O
has O
one O
other O
aircraft O
carrier O
, O
and O
this O
carrier O
in O
particular O
would O
allow O
the B-ORG
Indian I-ORG
Navy I-ORG
to O
extend O
its O
strategic O
strength O
much O
farther O
than O
it O
currently O
can O
now O
. O

So O
indeed O
Russia B-GPE
does O
have O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
influence O
here O
. O

These O
ties O
have O
gone O
way O
back O
, O
nearly B-DATE
40 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
and O
they O
were O
strengthened O
considerably O
by O
this O
visit O
. O

In O
fact O
both O
countries O
have O
now O
agreed O
to O
combat O
what O
they O
call O
terrorism O
with O
joint O
groups O
. O

They O
have O
also O
set O
up O
a O
joint O
working O
group O
on O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
which O
is O
of O
course O
a O
cause O
of O
concern O
for O
both O
countries O
. O

Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
by O
a O
Russian B-NORP
leader O
in O
seven B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Why O
does O
the O
trip O
come O
now O
? O

Well O
, O
his O
trip O
has O
actually O
been O
delayed O
for O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
of I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

Russian B-NORP
President O
was O
supposed O
to O
visit O
India B-GPE
as O
early O
as O
97 B-DATE
- O
1998 B-DATE
, O
but O
of O
course O
Boris B-PERSON
Yeltsin I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
health O
problems O
got O
in O
the O
way O
of O
that O
, O
and O
then O
of O
course O
, O
Mr. O
Yeltsin B-PERSON
's O
abrupt O
resignation O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
another O
visit O
and O
then O
the O
subsequent O
election O
campaign O
and O
inauguration O
of O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Putin I-PERSON
took O
some O
time O
, O
so O
it O
's O
been O
put O
off O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
. O

But O
there O
have O
also O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
delays O
in O
other O
areas O
. O

These O
arms O
agreements O
that O
we O
were O
just O
speaking O
about O
have O
taken O
quite O
some O
time O
to O
finalize O
. O

How O
does O
this O
visit O
by O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
compare O
to O
President O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
visit O
earlier B-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
? O

That O
's O
an O
interesting O
question O
because O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Putin I-PERSON
on O
Wednesday B-DATE
addressed O
the B-ORG
Indian I-ORG
Parliament I-ORG
just O
as O
Bill B-PERSON
Clinton I-PERSON
had O
done O
six B-DATE
months I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
's O
safe O
to O
say O
that O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
actually O
probably O
accomplished O
more O
than O
Mr. O
Clinton B-PERSON
did O
in O
the O
hard O
concrete O
terms O
of O
arms O
sales O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
, O
but O
it O
was O
Mr. O
Clinton B-PERSON
that O
stole O
the O
Indian B-NORP
lawmakers O
' O
hearts O
. O

Of O
course O
you O
will O
recall O
when O
he O
spoke O
to O
the O
parliament O
there O
was O
an O
ecstatic O
welcome O
for O
him O
. O

The O
Indian B-NORP
lawmakers O
were O
sort O
of O
clambering O
over O
each O
other O
to O
shake O
his O
hand O
as O
he O
left O
the O
parliament O
building O
. O

There O
was O
none O
of O
that O
for O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
, O
but O
he O
did O
receive O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome O
, O
although O
most O
ordinary O
Indians B-NORP
who O
were O
actually O
rather O
captivated O
by O
Mr. O
Clinton B-PERSON
's O
visit O
did O
not O
really O
pay O
much O
attention O
to O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
. O

In O
fact O
his O
visit O
has O
somewhat O
been O
ignored O
and O
in O
fact O
the O
main O
news O
story O
here O
in O

has O
been O
sort O
of O
a O
local O
controversy O
over O
the O
roll O

back O
of O
fuel O
prices O
rather O
than O
Mr. O
Putin B-PERSON
's O
visit O
, O
but O
he O
did O
do O
what O
he O
had O
to O
do O
and O
he O
certainly O
strengthened O

The O
worst O
was O
in O

Four B-CARDINAL

Barak B-PERSON

said O
Israel B-GPE
will O
continue O

use O
live O
ammunition O

They O
leave O
no O
other O
way O
for O
us O

to O
respond O
with O
fire O
, O
we O
'll O
have O
to O
do O
this O
. O

Palestinian B-NORP
leaders O
said O
their O
people O
no O
longer O
want O
a O
cease O

fire O
, O
they O
want O
their O

We O
are O
under O

The O
question O
should O
be O
what O
the O

still O
doing O
there O
eight B-DATE

go O

we O

even O
if O
the O

, O
Israelis B-NORP

will O
still O

an O
open O

so O
long O

so O
deep O

it O

a O
real O

sides O

almost O
stepped O
back O
six B-DATE

statements O

only O
finger O

deliberately O
launched O
it O

attract O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
world O
by O
paying O
with O
the O
blood O

his O
own O
people O

I O
urge O
Mr. O
Barak B-PERSON
to O
lift O
the O
siege O
of O
Palestinians B-NORP
, O
to O
speak O
to O
the O
Palestinians B-NORP
as O
its O
neighbors O
because O
they O
are O
his O
neighbors O
. O

The O
Palestinians B-NORP
clearly O
face O
the O
greatest O
pressure O
in O
this O
summit O
, O
since O
the O
Israelis B-NORP
are O
not O
the O
only O
ones O
blaming O
them O
for O
the O
outbreak O
of O
violence O
. O

I O
think O
we O
all O
know O
that O
Arafat B-PERSON
is O
in O
charge O
of O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
. O

He O
has O
the O
responsibility O
for O
controlling O
the O
violence O
. O

But O
it O
may O
not O
be O
so O
easy O
for O
Arafat B-PERSON
. O

Today B-DATE
, O
thousands B-CARDINAL
of O
Palestinians B-NORP
are O
calling O
for O
continued O
fighting O
. O

Half B-CARDINAL

the O
Palestinian B-NORP
population O
is O
under O
the B-DATE

When O

the O

you O

you O

that O

We O
've O
been O
saying O
for O
months B-DATE
now O
that O
the O
right O
step O
forward O
is O
for O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
to O
return O
to O
these O
talks O

but O
we O
really O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
logic O
in O
turning O
this O
into O
a O
test O
of O
wills O
between O
two B-CARDINAL
countries O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
and O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE

The O
fact O
is O
that O
China B-GPE
has O
the O
same O
interest O
as O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE

It O
should O
have O
the O
same O
interest O

that O
is O
to O
stop O
the O
North B-GPE

Our O
allies O

the O
Russians B-NORP
do O
as O
well O

so O
we O
think O
we O
're O
far O
better O
off O
working O
within O
the O
framework O
of O
the O
six B-CARDINAL
party O
talks O
because O
you O
get O
in O
that O
process O
the O
combined O
leverage O
the O
combined O
strength O

frankly O
the O
combined O
pressure O

all O
these O
different O
countries O

I O
simply O
do O
n't O
see O
why O
it O
's O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
the B-GPE

to O
get O
those O
countries O
out O
of O
the O
way O

only O
deal O
with O
North B-GPE
Korea I-GPE
directly O
/. O

So O
the O
problem O
here O
is O
not O
the O
lack O
of O
discussion O
between O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

North B-GPE

We O
're O
perfectly O

that O

in O
that O
sense O
it O
's O
analogous O
to O
what O
we O
're O
trying O
to O
do O
with O
Iran B-GPE

Secretary O

announced O
about B-DATE

that O

the O
Europeans B-NORP

really O
you O
know O

not O
a O
problem O

What O
they O
did O
the B-DATE

it O
the O
policy O

that O
we O

Well O
this O
is O
one B-CARDINAL

the O
most O
despotic O

certainly O
we O

come O

those O

live O

Uh O
what O
we O
've O
got O
to O
do O
now O

focus O
on O
the O
most O
immediate O
problem O

And O
that O
problem O
is O
nuclear O

The O
problem O
is O
the O
ballistic O
launches O
of O
the B-DATE
other I-DATE
day I-DATE

I O
think O
the O
thing O
to O
remember O
about O
those O
launches O
by O
the O
way O
they O
were O
provocative O
, O
they O
were O
reckless O
, O
they O
were O
also O
unsuccessful O

They O
fired O
four B-CARDINAL
scud O
missiles O
intermediate O

They O
tried O

fire O

unsuccessful O

crashed O

So O
we O
obviously O
have O
an O
opportunity O

opportunity O

calling O

then O
later O
he O
called O

was O

when O
that O
happened O

The B-NORP
North I-NORP

delighted O

care O
deeply O

this O
is O
another O
reason O

I O
think O
for O
a O
relatively O
cheap O

again O

set O
the O
stage O

a O
final O
agreement O
at O
the O
six B-CARDINAL

My O
point O
is O
if O
it O
's O
just O
going O
to O
be O
a O
face O
to O
face O
meeting O

serves O
as O
a O
precursor O

also O
deals O

directly O
hit O

think O
the O
timing O

Ambassador O

based O
on O

you O
believe O

would O
give O
up O

up O

I O
do O

know O

Um O
but O
that O
leaves O
me O
to O
conclude O
since O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
that O
it O
's O
a O
good O
idea O

It O
's O
a O
good O
idea O
it O
was O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
ninety I-DATE
four I-DATE
to O
do O
a O
deal O
with O

required O
them O
to O

up O

We O
did O
that O
/. O

and O
for O
a B-DATE
period I-DATE

we O
were O
in O
a O
position O
to O
monitor O
that O
closely O

and O
they O
did O
give O
it O
up O

Indeed O
you O
can O
make O
an O
argument O
that O
while O
the O
centrifuge O
program O
with O
the O
Pakistanis B-NORP
is O
clearly O
cheating O
was O
n't O
yet O

genuine O
nuclear O

produced O
anything O

probably O
still O
has O
n't O
produced O
anything O

So O
you O
have O
the O
possibility O
if O
the B-NORP
North I-NORP
Koreans I-NORP
are O
thinking O
the O
way O

may O

makes O
it O
unnecessary O
for O
them O

way O
to O
find O

. O

Although O
we O
live O
in O
the O

instead O
of O
the O
east O
and O
it O
did O
not O
affect O
us O
much O
, O
I O
think O
it O
is O
very O
useful O
, O
ah O
, O
to O
inform O
people O
of O
this O
kind O
of O

Well O

what O
in O

was O
the O
content O
of O
that O
SMS O
? O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
via O
this O
footage O
, O
ha O
. O

I O
remember O
the O
SMS O
was O
written O
like O
this O
at O
that O
time O
, O
saying O
that O
, O
ah O
, O
there O
was O
a O
sewage O
pipe O
leakage O
accident O
on O
the O
side O
road O
at O
the O
southeast O
corner O
of O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
at O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
and O
, O
well O
, O
traffic O
supervision O
was O
implemented O
near O
Chaoyang B-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
, O
and O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
and O
requesting O
cars O
to O
make O
a O
detour O
. O

Some O
car O
owners O
said O
that O
it O
was O
very O
good O
that O
the O
SMS O
was O
sent O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
was O
one B-CARDINAL
last O
sentence O
in O
that O
SMS O
thanking O
citizens O
for O
their O
cooperation O
and O
support O
. O

Ah O
, O
after O
the O
SMS O
was O
sent O
, O
, O
I O
felt O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
that O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
, O
ah O
, O
used O
an O
SMS O
to O
give O
notification O
at O
the O
time O
of O
a O
public O
emergency O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
all O
of O
us O
are O
living O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
is O
this O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
, O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
? O

Yes O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
an O
official O
notification O
, O
this O
should O
be O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
one O
was O
sent O
officially O
through O
1860 B-CARDINAL
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
in O
private O
life O
, O
people O
have O
used O
SMS O
countless O
times O
to O
spread O
news O
. O

Yes O
. O

Other O
places O
in O
the O
country O
must O
have O
used O
this O
too O
. O

Uh-huh O
, O
uh-huh O
. O

Must O
have O
used O
this O
too O
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
remember O
receiving O
an O
SMS O
like O
this O
one O
last B-DATE
year I-DATE
before O
it O
snowed O
, O
since O
snowfall O
would O
affect O
road O
conditions O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
to O
a O
rather O
large O
extent O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

However O
, O
it O
did O
not O
give O
people O
such O
a O
special O
feeling O
as O
it O
did O
this O
time O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Ah O
, O
when O
an O
SMS O
is O
sent O
to O
inform O
citizens O
of O
such O
an O
incident O
, O
can O
it O
be O
considered O
a O
work O
method O
or O
expression O
of O
government O
information O
transparency O
? O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
indeed O
through O
the O
very O
successful O
response O
to O
this O
emergency O
, O
ah O
, O
by O
Beijing B-ORG
Municipality I-ORG
, O
Uh-huh O
. O
an O
extremely O
good O
point O
that O
is O
worth O
pondering O
deeply O
, O
worthy O
innovation O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
previously O
our O
news O
announcements O
were O
made O
through O
some O
conventional O
methods O
, O
but O
this O
time O
it O
was O
made O
in O
the O
form O
of O
a O
mobile O
phone O
SMS O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
this O
is O
a O
method O
highly O
emphasized O
in O
various O
countries O
' O
development O
of O
e-government O
. O



We O
usually O
make O
it O
sound O
like O
e-government O
is O
something O
unattainable O
. O

Yes O
, O
when O
we O
talked O
about O
e-government O
in O
the O
past O
, O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
only O
done O
through O
the O
Internet O
. O

Right O
. O

It O
seemed O
that O
computers O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
the O
Internet O
, O
ah O
, O
were O
an O
expression O
of O
e-government O
, O
to O
let O
people O
find O
out O
information O
. O

Well O
, O
presently O
in O
fact O
, O
e-governments O
in O
various O
countries O
apply O
this O
so O
- O
called O
last O
multiple O
- O
exposure O
method O
, O
such O
as O
call O
centers O
, O
such O
as O
electronic O
IDs O
, O
and O
such O
as O
, O
these O
electronic O
signatures O
. O

These O
are O
quite O
sophisticated O
forms O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
more O
terminals O
, O
such O
as O
, O
this O
cable O
television O
, O
ah O
, O
, O
this O
digital O
television O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
mobile O
phone O
SMS O
, O
are O
applied O
in O
e-government O
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
, O
a O
test O
of O
e-government O
because O
, O
as O
I O
remember O
, O
during O
SARS O
in O
2003 B-DATE
, O
people O
at O
that O
time O
criticized O
e-government O
during O
the O
spread O
of O
SARS O
, O
ah O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

They O
said O
that O
e-government O
was O
very O
good O
but O
was O
not O
put O
into O
use O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
time O
I O
think O
that O
a O
short O
SMS O
like O
this O
can O
fully O
create O
interaction O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
public O
through O
this O
e-government O
form O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Yes O
. O

We O
drive O
often O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
ha O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
. O

If O
people O
were O
not O
informed O
of O
such O
a O
traffic O
accident O
through O
SMS O
on O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
and O
they O
continued O
to O
head O
there O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
would O
happen O
if O
people O
did O
not O
know O
what O
was O
going O
on O
and O
the O
jam O
did O
not O
clear O
? O

Yes O
. O

Ah O
, O
well O
, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
have O
been O
real O
paralysis O
. O

This O
is O
the O
most O
appropriate O
word O
to O
use O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
I O
think O
that O
when O
SMS O
was O
used O
to O
announce O
the O
news O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
to O
have O
fit O
the O
conditions O
in O
our O
China B-GPE
very O
well O
. O

Why O
is O
that O
so O
? O

This O
is O
because O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
China B-GPE
is O
the O
country O
with O
the O
highest O
SMS O
usage O
. O

There O
are O
probably O
not O
as O
many O
chances O
to O
use O
SMS O
in O
foreign O
countries O
compared O
with O
domestically O
, O
in O
China B-GPE
, O
ah O
. O

So O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
penetration O
was O
quite O
high O
this O
time O
, O
by O
using O
the O
most O
familiar O
method O
, O
most O
used O
by O
everyone O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
most O
prompt O
and O
most O
convenient O
method O
, O
for O
the O
announcement O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
many O
friends O
, O
around O
me O
received O
it O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
almost O
everyone O
received O
this O
SMS O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

The O
effect O
was O
extremely O
good O
, O
ha O
. O



So O
, O
how O
exactly O
did O
citizens O
react O
? O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
reactions O
of O
citizens O
. O

-- O
an O
SMS O
. O

I O
saw O
it O
was O
that B-FAC
Jingguang I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
say O
, O
this O
is O
quite O
good O
, O
quite O
good O
. O

Have O
you O
received O
information O
like O
this O
before O
? O

No O
, O
no O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
? O

Yes O
, O
yes O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
the O
speed O
at O
which O
the O
government O
responded O
this O
time O
? O

Quite O
fast O
. O

Really O
quite O
fast O
, O
ah O
. O

So O
, O
I O
did O
not O
drive O
today B-DATE
. O

I O
set O
out O
a O
bit O
earlier O
and O
took O
the O
subway O
here O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
that O
the O
response O
of O
the O
government O
was O
fast O
this O
time O
? O

Ah O
, O
the O
response O
was O
quite O
fast O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
various O
media O
announcements O
were O
also O
quite O
prompt O
. O

Colleagues O
and O
friends O
also O
informed O
one O
another O
by O
phone O
calls O
and O
SMS O
. O

I O
think O
this O
plan O
was O
quite O
speedy O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
through O
this O
kind O
of O
SMS O
, O
citizens O
responded O
very O
well O
and O
the O
effect O
was O
excellent O
, O
ha O
. O

Well O
, O
apart O
from O
the O
, O
ah O
, O
point O
on O
information O
disclosure O
brought O
out O
by O
this O
accident O
, O
the O
fact O
is O
that O
the O
activation O
of O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
by O
the O
, O
ah O
, O
government O
has O
also O
left O
people O
with O
a O
very O
deep O
impression O
. O

Let O
's O
find O
out O
the O
situation O
at O
that O
time O
through O
some O
footage O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
know O
that O
after O
the O
road O
cave O
- O
in O
accident O
, O
ah O
, O
ah O
, O
traffic O
police O
and O
emergency O
rescue O
personnel O
rushed O
to O
the O
scene O

ah O
, O
to O
direct O
traffic O
and O
carry O
out O
emergency O
repair O
of O
sewage O
pipes O
. O

Well O
, O
lots O
of O
barricade O

has O
been O
strung O
up O

said O
that O
he O
was O
there O
at O
4 B-TIME

. O

That O
means O
that O
they O
arrived O
at O
the O
scene O
right O
after O
the O
pre-dawn O
accident O
occurred O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
the O
traffic O
administration O
department O
was O
activated O
very O
quickly O
after O
receiving O
the O
news O
. O



Well O
, O
ah O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
you O
work O
at O
Traffic B-ORG
Radio I-ORG
Station I-ORG
, O
ha O
, O
well O
, O
and O
we O
know O
that O
you O
all O
gave O
an O
extensive O
live O
broadcast O
this O
morning O
. O

A O
special O
program O
. O

Yes O
, O
a O
special O
program O
on O
this O
traffic O
. O

So O
, O
let O
's O
first B-ORDINAL
turn O
our O
attention O
to O
the O
impact O
on O
traffic O
after O
the O
accident O
. O

Judging O
from O
the O
traffic O
control O
measures O
taken O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
eventual O
impact O
caused O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
are O
the O
effects O
? O

Actually O
, O
concerning O
this O
, O
I O
think O
both O
of O
you O
are O
very O
familiar O
with O
the O
traffic O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Previously O
we O
had O
a O
statistic O
, O
especially O
for O
the O
ring O
roads O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

That O
is O
, O
if O
we O
have O
an O
ordinary O
fender O
bender O
or O
tailgate O
accident O
on O
a O
bridge O
such O
as O
the B-FAC
Jingguang I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
of O
the B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
it O
might O
cause O
the O
entire O
Third B-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
to O
have O
bumper O
- O
to O
- O
bumper O
traffic O
jams O
during O
these O
morning O
and O
evening O
peak O
periods O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
might O
even O
impact O
traffic O
on O
the O
Second B-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
and O
Fourth B-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
. O

Well O
, O
ah O
, O
if O
there O
is O
an O
accident O
, O
from O
the O
time O
it O
occurs O
until O
the O
time O
all O
traffic O
is O
cleared O
, O
it O
probably O
takes O
about B-TIME
half I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
to I-TIME
an I-TIME
hour I-TIME
during O
peak O
periods O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
could O
not O
imagine O
imposing O
temporary O
traffic O
restriction O
measures O
on O
a O
long O
section O
of O
road O
stretching O
from O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
to O
Changhong B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
from O
the O
south O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Guomao B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
, O
blocking O
the O
main O
and O
side O
roads O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
situation O
would O
be O
unthinkable O
during O
this O
peak O
period O
that O
is O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
day O
of O
work O
for O
everyone O
. O

Hence O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
before O
6:30 B-TIME
a I-TIME
.m I-TIME
. I-TIME
today I-TIME
, O
before O
our O
live O
broadcast O
, O
we O
moved O
the O
broadcast O
forward O
, O
and O
before O
the O
live O
broadcast O
we O
were O
very O
worried O
. O

However O
, O
actually O
after O
the B-DATE
entire I-DATE
day I-DATE
today I-DATE
, O
I O
came O
here O
right O
after O
ending O
the O
live O
broadcast O
this O
evening O
to O
continue O
with O
the O
live O
broadcast O
here O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
today B-DATE
people O
indeed O
experienced O
an O
extremely O
high O
volume O
of O
traffic O
flow O
on O
the O
roads O
surrounding O
the O
section O
under O
traffic O
control O
, O
and O
indeed O
there O
was O
a O
very O
big O
traffic O
jam O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

However O
, O
the O
affected O
area O
was O
not O
as O
large O
as O
expected O
. O

Moreover O
, O
some O
people O
made O
detours O
once O
they O
received O
the O
news O
. O

Right O
. O

Psychologically O
, O
people O
felt O
quite O
relieved O
. O

Because O
I O
know O
this O
situation O
. O

Right O
, O
like O
those O
whom O
we O
interviewed O
just O
now O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
handle O
once O
everyone O
understood O
. O

Yes O
, O
ah O
, O
, O
a O
citizen O
, O
he O
said O
, O
I O
set O
out O
today B-DATE
before O
the O
incident O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
drive O
after O
I O
was O
informed O
. O

That O
person O
did O
not O
even O
drive O
. O

Right O
. O

Actually O
, O
in O
this O
aspect O
, O
I O
think O
that O
citizens O
were O
really O
quite O
cooperative O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
this O
evening O
, O
we O
, O
received O
an O
SMS O
. O

A O
friend O
said O
, O
I O
work O
on O
the O
12th B-ORDINAL
floor O
of O
the B-FAC
China I-FAC
World I-FAC
Trade I-FAC
Center I-FAC
at O
the B-FAC
Guomao I-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
, O
ah O
. O

We O
were O
discussing O
that O
we O
could O
go O
home O
in O
fewer O
cars O
since O
everyone O
was O
on O
the O
same O
route O
. O

Later O
on O
, O
we O
suggested O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
you O
, O
ah O
, O
might O
as O
well O
take O
the O
subway O
, O
because O
you O
can O
directly O
reach O
the O
subway O
once O
you O
get O
down O
from O
the B-FAC
China I-FAC
World I-FAC
Trade I-FAC
Center I-FAC
. O

Right O
. O

Hey O
, O
he O
said O
this O
was O
quite O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
think O
everyone O
was O
quite O
cooperative O
and O
also O
quite O
supportive O
in O
this O
aspect O
. O



Yes O
, O
many O
, O
viewers O
not O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
may O
not O
be O
quite O
familiar O
, O
ah O
, O
with O
this O
road O
section O
we O
just O
mentioned O
, O
where O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
accident O
occurred O
. O

Ah O
, O
we O
can O
take O
a O
look O
later O
through O
an O
animation O
. O

This O
road O
represents O
a O
main O
road O
on O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
, O
with O
problems O
on O
both O
the O
main O
and O
side O
roads O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
Chaoyang B-FAC
Road I-FAC
is O
an O
intersection O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Whether O
it O
is O
Chaoyang B-FAC
Road I-FAC
in O
the O
east O
- O
west O
direction O
or O
the O
main O
and O
side O
roads O
of O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
in O
the O
south O
- O
north O
direction O
, O
as O
we O
can O
see O
from O
this O
diagram O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
the O
area O
at O
the O
main O
and O
side O
roads O
of O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
normally O
has O
quite O
heavy O
traffic O
, O
especially O
during O
commuting O
times O
. O

Well O
, O
Chaoyang B-FAC
Road I-FAC
is O
a O
very O
important O
artery O
in O
the O
east O
- O
west O
direction O
. O

Yes O
. O

When O
people O
living O
in O
the O
west O
want O
to O
cross O
over O
from O
the O
city O
, O
they O
have O
to O
go O
via O
this O
road O
. O

Hence O
, O
if O
a O
traffic O
accident O
occurs O
at O
this O
place O
, O
we O
can O
indeed O
imagine O
, O
ha O
, O
how O
widespread O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
impact O
will O
be O
, O
such O
as O
the O
number O
of O
cars O
caught O
in O
traffic O
jams O
. O

Yes O
, O
actually O
I O
think O
everyone O
can O
see O
that O
from O
the O
buses O
that O
cross O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
. O

Yes O
. O

As O
buses O
that O
cross O
the B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
are O
currently O
, O
right O
now O
affected O
by O
the O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
accident O
, O
ah O
, O
the O
latest O
results O
this O
morning O
show O
that O
32 B-CARDINAL
bus O
routes O
throughout O
the O
neighborhood O
have O
had O
to O
be O
rerouted O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
perhaps O
many O
friends O
in O
other O
places O
are O
wondering O
how O
one B-CARDINAL
place O
is O
able O
to O
accommodate O
32 B-CARDINAL
commuter O
routes O
. O

If O
the O
accident O
did O
not O
happen O
, O
perhaps O
everyone O
would O
not O
know O
that O
this O
place O
could O
normally O
have O
so O
many O
-- O

It O
is O
really O
like O
this O
, O
just O
look O
at O
the O
bus O
signs O
. O

Right O
. O

Have O
not O
seen O
so O
many O
buses O
. O

Right O
. O

Its O
effect O
on O
people O
has O
been O
extremely O
extensive O
. O

Yes O
. O



Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
what O
measures O
did O
the O
traffic O
control O
department O
eventually O
take O
to O
direct O
traffic O
? O

. O

In O
the O
roads O
close O
to O
where O
the O
problem O
emerged O
, O
we O
first B-ORDINAL
set O
up O

at O
the O

this O
way O
, O
all O

going O
along O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC

had O
to O
make O
a O

In O
order O
to O

210 B-CARDINAL
additional O

to O
divert O

It O
can O

were O
very O
promptly O
taken O

Well O
, O
what O
exactly O
was O
the O
situation O
this O
morning O

from O

at O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC

ah O

the O

here O
that O
lead O
to O
the O

have O
come O
under O

, O
well O
, O
various O
kinds O
of O

have O
also O
been O

at O
very O

has O
fallen O
to O

, O
since O

, O
the O
number O

was O
significantly O
less O
than O

very O
orderly O

at O
the O
scene O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Right O
, O
right O
. O

, O
through O
your O
listeners O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
feedback O
did O
you O
find O
out O
from O
them O
? O

Actually O
, O
this O
morning O
, O
some O
listeners O
, O
ah O
, O
also O
happened O
to O
tell O
us O
about O
it O
via O
mobile O
phone O
SMS O
. O

Since O
we O
know O
that O
Jingguang B-FAC
Bridge I-FAC
is O
located O
in O
the O
CBD B-GPE
district O
, O
well O
there O
are O
many O
office O
buildings O
, O
ah O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
, O
as O
well O
as O
quite O
a O
lot O
of O
friends O
who O
get O
up O
early B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning I-TIME
to O
go O
to O
work O
. O

Therefore O
, O
they O
sent O
SMS O
saying O
, O
hey O
, O
it O
is O
unusual O
, O
ah O
, O
for O
me O
to O
be O
walking O
to O
the O
bus O
station O
today B-DATE
or O
going O
to O
take O
the O
bus O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
is O
unusual O
for O
me O
to O
enjoy O
a O
very O
pleasant O
morning O
. O

We O
then O
reminded O
everyone O
to O
wear O
extra O
clothing O
. O

This O
shows O
that O
when O
people O
encounter O
such O
kind O
of O
emergency O
, O
they O
have O
started O
to O
be O
able O
to O
face O
it O
with O
a O
very O
calm O
and O
pleasant O
state O
of O
mind O
. O

I O
think O
that O
this O
mentality O
in O
facing O
emergencies O
, O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
respect O
shows O
a O
great O
change O
of O
mentality O
that O
Beijing B-GPE
citizens O
now O
have O
after O
enduring O
several O
tests O
in O
the O
past O
, O
and O
a O
kind O
of O
calmness O
and O
maturity O
after O
having O
experienced O
frustrations O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
think O
it O
can O
also O
fully O
show O
the O
level O
of O
people O
's O
satisfaction O
with O
emergency O
mechanisms O
of O
the O
operational O
departments O
of O
the O
government O
in O
handling O
this O
incident O
. O

That O
is O
, O
they O
think O
that O
the O
government O
has O
tried O
its O
best O
. O

Well O
, O
in O
this O
respect O
, O
we O
citizens O
should O
also O
contribute O
our O
efforts O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

As O
such O
, O
in O
this O
regard O
, O
I O
think O
people O
's O
mentality O
can O
become O
very O
calm O
. O



Uh-huh O
. O

Well O
, O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
from O
this O
perspective O
, O
is O
this O
one B-CARDINAL
highly O
positive O
effect O
achieved O
after O
information O
was O
disclosed O
? O

Yes O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
citizens O
' O
mentality O
. O

Yes O
, O
in O
fact O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
from O
this O
particular O
case O
. O

That O
is O
, O
when O
the O
government O
was O
handling O
this O
kind O
of O
public O
emergency O
, O
well O
, O
it O
went O
from O
a O
traditionally O
unilateral O
administrative O
management O
method O
, O
well O
, O
a O
method O
in O
which O
information O
was O
quite O
delayed O
, O
to O
disclosure O
and O
transparency O
of O
information O
, O
and O
very O
fast O
as O
well O
. O

We O
know O
that O
in O
the O
past O
, O
disclosure O
of O
information O
had O
to O
be O
reported O
to O
higher O
authorities O
, O
level O
by O
level O
, O
until O
the O
highest O
authorities O
had O
given O
approval O
, O
before O
information O
could O
be O
disclosed O
. O

Time O
was O
lost O
. O

Well O
, O
yes O
, O
the B-ORG
State I-ORG
Council I-ORG
has O
, O
er O
, O
put O
forth O
a O
regulation O
concerning O
the O
establishment O
of O
public O
early O
warning O
mechanisms O
. O

That O
is O
, O
related O
information O
that O
can O
be O
publicized O
will O
be O
publicized O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
in O
order O
to O
guide O
people O
in O
what O
to O
do O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
related O
interaction O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
people O
can O
be O
formed O
. O

That O
is O
, O
in O
modern O
public O
management O
, O
ah O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
good O
case O
, O
that O
is O
, O
of O
shifting O
from O
a O
kind O
of O
unilateral O
administrative O
management O
to O
public O
management O
and O
to O
positive O
interaction O
between O
the O
government O
and O
the O
people O
. O

I O
think O
in O
fact O
, O
we O
can O
sum O
up O
many O
beneficial O
experiences O
from O
this O
case O
and O
actually O
extend O
them O
to O
other O
areas O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
when O
we O
look O
at O
this O
case O
from O
the O
perspective O
of O
traffic O
. O



Traffic O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
thing O
to O
be O
impacted O
when O
this O
, O
cave O
- O
in O
accident O
occurred O
. O

However O
, O
this O
accident O
actually O
involved O
many O
underground O
pipes O
, O
such O
as O
sewage O
pipes O
, O
ah O
, O
or O
water O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
gas O
, O
ah O
, O
pipes O
, O
that O
affect O
the O
lives O
of O
citizens O
in O
many O
other O
aspects O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
do O
you O
know O
how O
many O
pipes O
there O
are O
underground O
? O

Right O
now O
, O
there O
should O
be O
seven O
main O
types O
of O
pipes O
buried O
underground O
. O

They O
include O
those O
like O
you O
just O
mentioned O
, O
as O
well O
as O
pipes O
like O
those O
for O
heating O
and O
communication O
, O
among O
others O
. O

Truly O
, O
these O
pipes O
are O
closely O
linked O
to O
the O
lives O
of O
citizens O
. O

Closely O
linked O
. O

Yes O
, O
therefore O
besides O
our O
attention O
to O
the O
traffic O
issue O
just O
now O
, O
people O
are O
also O
very O
concerned O
, O
ah O
, O
with O
the O
situation O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
with O
other O
aspects O
affecting O
citizens O
' O
lives O
. O

Let O
's O
take O
a O
look O
again O
at O
this O
footage O
of O
the O
situation O
of O
dealing O
with O
the O
current O
scene O
. O

Ah O
, O
according O
to O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
the B-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Municipal I-ORG
Construction I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
, O
ah O
, O
the B-ORG
Communication I-ORG
Commission I-ORG
, O
ah O
, O
and O
telecommunication O
, O
traffic O
, O
and O
other O
departments O
have O
assigned O
personnel O
to O
participate O
in O
emergency O
repair O
work O
. O

Relevant O
departments O
said O
that O
they O
will O
adopt O
a O
full O
range O
of O
measures O
to O
minimize O
the O
level O
of O
impact O
on O
people O
's O
daily O
lives O
and O
work O
, O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
stable O
order O
in O
society O
during O
the O
recovery O
period O
. O

Well O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
government O
's O
response O
to O
this O
cave O
- O
in O
accident O
, O
ah O
, O
we O
should O
say O
it O
was O
very O
prompt O
with O
traffic O
management O
and O
emergency O
repair O
, O
ah O
, O
because O
it O
involved O
various O
aspects O
of O
life O
. O



Well O
, O
ah O
, O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
as O
this O
incident O
involved O
many O
departments O
after O
it O
took O
place O
, O
how O
do O
you O
think O
the O
various O
departments O
should O
coordinate O
between O
themselves O
? O

Yes O
. O

This O
is O
also O
-- O

It O
is O
not O
the O
case O
that O
this O
problem O
will O
be O
totally O
solved O
when O
one O
department O
shows O
up O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
think O
as O
we O
build O
this O
kind O
, O
er O
, O
of O
public O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
emergency O
mechanism O
for O
public O
incidents O
, O
ah O
, O
has O
been O
the O
, O
most O
difficult O
to O
resolve O
, O
an O
actual O
problem O
that O
has O
been O
the O
most O
difficult O
to O
resolve O
among O
administrative O
management O
reforms O
in O
various O
countries O
. O

How O
many O
groups O
of O
people O
will O
be O
sent O
? O

Many O
groups O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
is O
because O
social O
management O
requires O
division O
of O
labor O
in O
society O
. O

It O
is O
necessarily O
a O
labor O
division O
trend O
that O
involves O
many O
departments O
, O
and O
in O
addition O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
modern O
management O
public O
administration O
model O
which O
is O
diversified O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

How O
can O
cooperation O
be O
formed O
between O
departments O
in O
this O
kind O
of O
situation O
? O

Well O
, O
sometimes O
under O
normal O
circumstances O
, O
sometimes O
, O
we O
often O
feel O
that O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
for O
departments O
to O
cooperate O
with O
one O
another O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there O
are O
too O
many O
law O
enforcement O
departments O
and O
, O
ah O
, O
too O
many O
administrative O
departments O
, O
and O
very O
often O
in O
the O
end O
, O
they O
are O
unable O
to O
coordinate O
. O

However O
, O
this O
time O
, O
through O
the O
execution O
of O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
by O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
this O
time O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
the O
response O
speed O
of O
the O
different O
departments O
of O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
integrated O
emergency O
mechanisms O
, O
played O
a O
great O
role O
. O

Hence O
, O
I O
think O
this O
was O
also O
a O
kind O
of O
, O
er O
, O
trial O
of O
interdepartmental O
cooperation O
mechanisms O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
was O
a O
very O
successful O
, O
er O
, O
response O
. O

I O
think O
many O
good O
things O
can O
be O
summed O
up O
from O
this O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
based O
on O
your O
understanding O
, O
ah O
, O
as O
pipes O
that O
directly O
affect O
many O
common O
people O
's O
lives O
were O
damaged O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
based O
on O
your O
understanding O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
how O
was O
remedial O
work O
carried O
out O
? O

For O
instance O
, O
it O
is O
very O
cold O
during O
winter O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
, O
and O
the O
temperature O
last B-TIME
night I-TIME
dropped O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
lowest O
points O
recently O
. O

Er O
, O
heating O
pipes O
were O
indeed O
damaged O
. O

Well O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
it O
affected O
residents O
living O
in O
an O
area O
of O
about B-QUANTITY
70,000 I-QUANTITY
square I-QUANTITY
meters I-QUANTITY
of O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Well O
, O
, O
in O
this O
regard O
, O
the O
Chaoyang B-GPE
district O
government O
did O
a O
very O
good O
job O
. O

After O
it O
, O
er O
, O
received O
this O
order O
from O
the O
municipal O
government O
, O
it O
immediately O
sent O
, O
electric O
heaters O
to O
residents O
in O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
200 I-CARDINAL
households O
within O
this O
area O
. O

It O
should O
be O
said O
that O
many O
residents O
spent O
quite O
a O
warm O
night O
at O
home O
yesterday B-DATE
. O

Well O
, O
furthermore O
, O
in O
the O
emergency O
repair O
process O
, O
ah O
, O
it O
should O
be O
said O
that O
the O
heating O
pipeline O
was O
restored O
relatively O
quickly O
. O

Hence O
, O
over O
here O
, O
I O
think O
the O
municipal O
government O
, O
ah O
, O
including O
sub-district O
offices O
, O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
to O
take O
good O
care O
of O
resident O
households O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
done O
in O
a O
very O
humanitarian O
manner O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O



Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
actually O
for O
such O
a O
large O
scale O
city O
as O
Beijing B-GPE
that O
has O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
14 I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
people O
, O
ah O
, O
for O
such O
a O
big O
city O
, O
a O
suddenly O
occurring O
public O
emergency O
like O
this O
should O
be O
said O
to O
be O
relatively O
common O
. O

Yes O
. O

I O
think O
it O
should O
be O
unexpected O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
within O
expectations O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
we O
see O
that O
other O
, O
er O
, O
domestic O
and O
overseas O
cities O
have O
experienced O
similar O
incidents O
. O

Perhaps O
many O
overseas O
cities O
have O
had O
such O
kind O
of O
thing O
before O
. O

This O
is O
because O
a O
city O
is O
a O
gathering O
place O
for O
modern O
life O
. O

It O
is O
a O
highly O
civilized O
place O
, O
as O
well O
as O
, O
however O
, O
in O
fact O
a O
gathering O
point O
for O
various O
conflicts O
, O
social O
, O
economic O
, O
security O
, O
various O
aspects O
of O
conflict O
. O

Hence O
it O
is O
not O
at O
all O
surprising O
for O
such O
an O
accident O
to O
occur O
. O

The O
critical O
thing O
is O
-- O

But O
the O
critical O
thing O
is O
how O
emergency O
plans O
are O
activated O
after O
the O
occurrence O
of O
such O
accidents O
, O
and O
for O
a O
city O
, O
this O
is O
a O
test O
of O
its O
response O
capabilities O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
think O
through O
a O
few O
incidents O
that O
happened O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
over O
recent B-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
such O
as O
SARS O
, O
the O
snowfall O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
the O
heavy O
rains O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
and O
the O
road O
cave O
- O
in O
at O
East B-FAC
Third I-FAC
Ring I-FAC
Road I-FAC
this O
time O
, O
I O
think O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
that O
Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
's I-GPE
response O
capabilities O
continued O
to O
improve O
each O
time O
. O

Right O
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
this O
time O
, O
what O
was O
done O
has O
received O
favorable O
comments O
from O
everyone O
. O



Um O
, O
well O
, O
I O
think O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
perhaps O
you O
have O
stronger O
feelings O
on O
this O
aspect O
, O
ah O
. O

Yes O
. O

Because O
you O
often O
have O
this O
kind O
of O
direct O
SMS O
exchange O
with O
listeners O
. O

It O
is O
because O
, O
we O
, O
Beijing B-ORG
Traffic I-ORG
Radio I-ORG
Station I-ORG
, O
has O
become O
a O
part O
of O
emergency O
planning O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Well O
, O
Beijing B-ORG
Traffic I-ORG
Radio I-ORG
Station I-ORG
is O
to O
be O
activated O
as O
a O
media O
for O
emergency O
plans O
that O
are O
grade O
three B-CARDINAL
and O
above O
. O

Well O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
as O
people O
still O
vividly O
remember O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
that O
snowfall O
just O
mentioned O
by O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
that O
people O
still O
vividly O
remember O
, O
there O
were O
no O
plans O
. O

Beijing B-GPE
Municipality I-GPE
still O
had O
no O
emergency O
plan O
. O

Well O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
it O
happened O
that O
I O
was O
hosting O
the O
Unblocked B-ORG
All I-ORG
the I-ORG
Way I-ORG
program O
in O
the O
studio O
that B-TIME
evening I-TIME
. O

Well O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
traffic O
was O
not O
at O
all O
unblocked O
. O

Ah O
, O
at O
that O
time O
there O
was O
none O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
interaction O
. O

It O
was O
not O
clear O
, O
it O
was O
very O
congested O
. O

You O
sat O
inside O
the O
studio O
and O
only O
knew O
about O
the O
heavy O
snowfall O
. O

You O
could O
find O
out O
other O
news O
only O
by O
telephone O
. O

The O
various O
methods O
and O
channels O
were O
extremely O
unclear O
. O

Well O
, O
later O
, O
when O
we O
experienced O
that O
rainfall O
in O
Beijing O
, O
that O
rainfall O
two B-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
, O
as O
well O
as O
some O
days O
of O
sand O
storms O
, O
all O
channels O
and O
early O
warning O
mechanisms O
were O
activated O
in O
quite O
an O
orderly O
manner O
. O

From O
our O
perspective O
as O
media O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
precisely O
by O
going O
through O
those O
breaking O
- O
in O
, O
trials O
that O
we O
could O
be O
so O
calm O
in O
handling O
such O
an O
emergency O
today B-DATE
, O
ah O
, O
and O
give O
everyone O
the O
most O
effective O
announcements O
and O
notifications O
, O
and O
instructions O
. O

Yes O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
a O
local O
media O
in O
this O
city O
, O
it O
should O
become O
a O
proactive O
participant O
when O
there O
is O
a O
public O
emergency O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Yes O
. O

It O
should O
play O
its O
individual O
role O
in O
the O
process O
of O
resolving O
emergencies O
. O



Ah O
, O
apart O
from O
this O
, O
Professor O
Zhou B-PERSON
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
are O
the O
areas O
for O
improvement O
for O
a O
city O
, O
especially O
a O
booming O
city O
, O
when O
handling O
this O
kind O
of O
public O
emergency O
? O

Right O
, O
I O
think O
this O
gave O
us O
many O
revelations O
, O
ah O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
I O
think O
one O
that O
should O
be O
especially O
important O
is O
early O
warnings O
and O
forecasts O
. O

This O
is O
because O
currently O
, O
there O
are O
, O
ah O
, O
frequently O
various O
kinds O
of O
risks O
lurking O
in O
cities O
, O
ah O
. O

Early O
warnings O
and O
forecasts O
. O

Yes O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
early O
warning O
and O
forecast O
mechanism O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

It O
is O
not O
only O
for O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
sudden O
road O
cave O
- O
in O
, O
it O
also O
includes O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
security O
incidents O
, O
ah O
, O
in O
our O
society O
, O
as O
well O
as O
natural O
disasters O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
including O
public O
health O
incidents O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

That O
is O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
scientific O
early O
warning O
and O
forecast O
mechanism O
must O
be O
set O
up O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

In O
this O
way O
, O
you O
can O
manage O
and O
resolve O
an O
abnormal O
situation O
by O
turning O
it O
into O
a O
normal O
situation O
, O
without O
evolving O
into O
a O
sudden O
public O
emergency O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
want O
to O
say O
is O
that O
besides O
, O
ah O
, O
emergency O
response O
and O
speedy O
integration O
mechanisms O
, O
I O
think O
some O
corresponding O
improvements O
should O
be O
made O
to O
the O
release O
of O
information O
, O
incident O
investigation O
, O
ah O
, O
and O
the O
relevant O
post-incident O
, O
responsibility O
system O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
, O
that O
is O
, O
we O
should O
say O
that O
the O
government O
already O
has O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
relevant O
systems O
in O
this O
respect O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
we O
have O
an O
administrative O
investigation O
system O
for O
incidents O
of O
major O
responsibility O
. O

We O
have O
regulations O
on O
investigation O
procedures O
for O
very O
major O
incidents O
, O
as O
well O
as O
others O
such O
as O
emergency O
response O
methods O
for O
handling O
public O
health O
incidents O
and O
public O
health O
emergencies O
, O
among O
others O
. O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
we O
have O
many O
corresponding O
systems O
. O

However O
, O
the O
question O
is O
how O
city O
management O
, O
er O
, O
handles O
these O
various O
kinds O
of O
perhaps O
unpredictable O
cases O
. O

Since O
we O
are O
entering O
new O
circumstances O
of O
human O
living O
, O
circumstances O
that O
contain O
high O
risk O
and O
have O
an O
increasingly O
developed O
urbanized O
life O
, O
well O
, O
I O
think O
corresponding O
improvements O
should O
be O
made O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
a O
series O
of O
systems O
that O
includes O
scientific O
planning O
, O
early O
warning O
and O
forecast O
, O
emergency O
response O
, O
accident O
investigation O
, O
and O
accountability O
. O



Um O
, O
well O
, O
based O
on O
your O
understanding O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
and O
from O
an O
international O
perspective O
, O
what O
are O
some O
better O
ways O
of O
urban O
management O
that O
are O
worthwhile O
for O
us O
to O
learn O
? O

I O
think O
, O
in O
comparison O
to O
China B-GPE
, O
we O
should O
say O
that O
urbanization O
in O
foreign O
countries O
developed O
earlier O
and O
is O
more O
widespread O
. O

Their O
level O
of O
development O
is O
more O
advanced O
than O
ours O
. O

Although O
the O
scale O
of O
our O
urbanization O
is O
currently O
expanding O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
1 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
per O
year O
, O
I O
think O
, O
with O
our O
economic O
development O
being O
relatively O
backward O
, O
we O
actually O
still O
have O
many O
aspects O
of O
urban O
management O
to O
learn O
from O
foreign O
countries O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
many O
of O
the O
pipes O
involved O
in O
this O
incident O
were O
basic O
infrastructure O
, O
public O
utilities O
industries O
. O

With O
a O
background O
of O
liberalization O
, O
marketization O
, O
and O
privatization O
, O
how O
can O
the O
government O
strengthen O
supervision O
of O
public O
utilities O
industries O
? O

How O
can O
a O
safe O
, O
assured O
system O
be O
established O
? O

Well O
, O
we O
need O
to O
learn O
and O
manage O
this O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
regarding O
information O
disclosure O
, O
well O
, O
our O
speed O
of O
information O
disclosure O
this O
time O
was O
very O
fast O
. O

However O
, O
we O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
to O
do O
in O
making O
the O
information O
disclosure O
, O
er O
, O
system O
more O
standardized O
, O
that O
is O
, O
to O
really O
implement O
a O
system O
of O
levels O
of O
responsibility O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
also O
need O
to O
explore O
how O
cooperation O
mechanisms O
between O
departments O
execute O
cooperation O
under O
normal O
situations O
and O
, O
well O
, O
how O
departments O
should O
cooperate O
with O
one O
another O
under O
these O
kinds O
of O
public O
emergency O
circumstances O
. O

Well O
, O
for O
some O
of O
our O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
, O
well O
, O
ah O
, O
how O
will O
these O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
withstand O
these O
tests O
? O

We O
know O
that O
currently O
, O
many O
ministries O
and O
commissions O
, O
as O
well O
as O
people O
's O
governments O
at O
the O
provincial O
level O
, O
along O
with O
those O
at O
municipal O
and O
district O
levels O
, O
have O
set O
up O
emergency O
contingency O
plans O
for O
public O
emergencies O
, O
but O
many O
of O
them O
have O
not O
been O
put O
to O
the O
test O
. O

Well O
, O
how O
will O
they O
undergo O
testing O
? O

These O
also O
include O
some O
of O
our O
command O
and O
policy O
- O
making O
systems O
. O

So O
, O
with O
the O
growth O
of O
urbanization O
and O
with O
more O
and O
more O
of O
such O
complicated O
issues O
, O
ah O
, O
I O
think O
there O
will O
be O
increasingly O
high O
requirements O
on O
the O
systems O
. O

That O
is O
, O
development O
of O
future O
systems O
is O
one O
of O
the O
top O
current O
priorities O
. O

How O
can O
we O
institutionalize O
our O
response O
mechanisms O
and O
make O
them O
into O
a O
system O
so O
as O
to O
ensure O
the O
lifestyle O
of O
people O
who O
live O
in O
such O
a O
large O
- O
scale O
city O
? O

The B-ORG
State I-ORG
Council I-ORG
has O
proposed O
a O
public O
emergency O
contingency O
plan O
, O
called O
One B-CARDINAL
Plan O
, O
Three B-CARDINAL
Systems O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

" O
One B-CARDINAL
plan O
" O
refers O
to O
the O
contingency O
plan O
, O
and O
" O
three B-CARDINAL
systems O
" O
refers O
to O
systems O
of O
organizations O
, O
mechanisms O
, O
and O
laws O
. O

So O
, O
I O
think O
we O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
to O
do O
in O
these O
three B-CARDINAL
areas O
of O
organizations O
, O
mechanisms O
, O
and O
laws O
. O



Yes O
. O

Well O
, O
finally O
, O
let O
's O
turn O
our O
attention O
to O
handling O
of O
the O
situation O
, O
ah O
, O
during O
the O
latter O
stages O
of O
the O
cave O
- O
in O
accident O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

Traffic O
, O
ah O
, O
can O
be O
said O
to O
have O
been O
directed O
, O
and O
is O
basically O
under O
control O
now O
. O

Well O
, O
following O
this O
, O
repairs O
have O
to O
be O
made O
on O
this O
road O
section O
where O
the O
accident O
occurred O
, O
including O
for O
many O
pipes O
. O

Well O
, O
Yang B-PERSON
Yang I-PERSON
, O
based O
on O
your O
understanding O
, O
how O
long O
will O
it O
take O
? O

I O
think O
that O
the O
time O
really O
depends O
on O
how O
the O
overall O
repair O
goes O
. O

This O
is O
because O
exploration O
, O
assessment O
, O
and O
repair O
are O
carried O
out O
in O
succession O
. O

Therefore O
, O
regarding O
this O
work O
progress O
, O
to O
repair O
this O
road O
section O
in O
the O
shortest O
time O
, O
um O
, O
this O
will O
depend O
on O
the O
work O
progress O
. O

Uh-huh O
. O

This O
is O
because O
repair O
is O
probably O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
repairing O
the O
road O
surface O
alone O
. O

There O
is O
also O
an O
issue O
with O
many O
of O
the O
pipes O
below O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
pipes O
below O
. O

Right O
, O
as O
it O
is O
winter O
, O
we O
know O
that O
carrying O
out O
construction O
during O
winter O
, O
especially O
that O
which O
requires O
pouring O
concrete O
and O
then O
-- O

Moreover O
, O
it O
is O
especially O
difficult O
for O
concrete O
to O
set O
during O
winter O
. O

Yes O
, O
preparation O
mix O
for O
making O
it O
dry O
faster O
, O
has O
already O
been O
added O
. O

But O
in O
the O
end O
, O
it O
requires O
time O
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
depends O
very O
much O
on O
factors O
like O
temperature O
. O

Just O
now O
, O
you O
mentioned O
that O
there O
are O
many O
pipes O
, O
ah O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
there O
is O
a O
key O
heating O
pipeline O
. O

The O
first O
thing O
is O
to O
ensure O
that O
it O
is O
connected O
in O
time O
. O

Yes O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
waste O
discharge O
is O
also O
very O
important O
. O

Waste O
discharged O
has O
currently O
blocked O
this O
up O
. O

Um O
, O
and O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
optical O
fibers O
, O
ah O
. O

Er O
, O
right O
now O
, O
if O
the O
optical O
fibers O
break O
, O
people O
in O
many O
households O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
watch O
television O
. O

Yes O
. O

At O
present O
, O
we O
should O
not O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
watching O
television O
. O

They O
are O
not O
broken O
. O

It O
is O
just O
that O
, O
as O
the O
other O
pipes O
have O
to O
be O
repaired O
, O
the O
optical O
fibers O
have O
to O
be O
rearranged O
, O
to O
be O
hung O
up O
it O
seems O
. O

After O
that O
, O
or O
it O
seems O
that O
a O
few O
steel O
pipes O
have O
been O
added O
below O
to O
make O
it O
safer O
to O
walk O
across O
this O
section O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
let O
's O
take O
water O
pipes O
as O
an O
example O
. O

Because O
they O
were O
exposed O
, O
The O
water O
pipes O
were O
not O
-- O

after O
that O
, O
yes O
, O
these O
were O
not O
damaged O
. O

they O
were O
not O
damaged O
and O
this O
is O
quite O
normal O
. O

Um O
, O
there O
is O
no O
problem O
with O
water O
supply O
. O

figure O
of O
120 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Many O
people O
quote O
a O
figure O
of O
150 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Let O
's O
think O
about O
it O
this O
way O
. O

If O
we O
actually O
use O
120 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
as O
the O
statistic O
for O
the O
group O
who O
leave O
the O
country O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
, O
at O
least O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
are O
um O
, O
married O
before O
they O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
families O
of O
these O
married O
people O
will O
usually O
have O
children O
. O

Moreover O
, O
they O
will O
usually O
have O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
child O
in O
rural O
areas O
. O

So O
you O
can O
imagine O
. O

I O
believe O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
group O
is O
definitely O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
10 I-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
20 I-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

It O
, O
uh O
, O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
should O
be O
around O
50 B-CARDINAL
million I-CARDINAL
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
have O
not O
conducted O
exact O
statistical O
calculations O
. O

I O
believe O
the O
number O
of O
this O
group O
should O
be O
particularly O
large O
. O

According O
to O
the O
study O
by O
the O
task O
force O
, O
at O
present O
, O
the O
four B-CARDINAL
main O
types O
of O
custody O
for O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
include O
single O
- O
parent O
custody O
, O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
, O
relative O
custody O
, O
and O
same O
- O
generation O
custody O
. O
Among O
which O
, O
single O
- O
parent O
custody O
had O
the O
highest O
number O
, O
accounting O
for O
79.2 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
people O
surveyed O
. O

The O
next O
one B-CARDINAL
was O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
, O
accounting O
for O
16.9 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
. O
While O
those O
who O
lived O
with O
relatives O
or O
were O
entrusted O
to O
the O
care O
of O
someone O
else O
made O
up O
4.1 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
and O
.9 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
total O
number O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
respectively O
. O



According O
to O
your O
study O
, O
what O
do O
these O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
generally O
do O
with O
their O
daily O
life O
if O
their O
parents O
or O
parent O
work O
in O
the O
city O
? O

Different O
types O
of O
custody O
have O
different O
impacts O
on O
their O
life O
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
, O
single O
- O
parent O
custody O
definitely O
creates O
less O
impact O
compared O
to O
the O
other O
types O
. O

The O
impact O
of O
single O
- O
parent O
custody O
is O
smaller O
because O
at O
least O
the O
mother O
is O
at O
home O
. O

There O
is O
no O
major O
problem O
in O
the O
children O
's O
material O
life O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
there O
are O
many O
impacts O
in O
other O
aspects O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
peer O
socialization O
. O

The O
one B-CARDINAL
that O
creates O
a O
huge O
impact O
is O
definitely O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
. O

Skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
means O
the O
grandparents O
look O
after O
the O
children O
. O

There O
is O
also O
relative O
or O
neighbor O
custody O
that O
asks O
neighbors O
or O
relatives O
to O
look O
after O
the O
children O
, O
and O
there O
is O
a O
type O
called O
self O
- O
custody O
. O

These O
three B-CARDINAL
types O
create O
the O
biggest O
and O
the O
most O
impact O
. O

If O
we O
want O
to O
discuss O
this O
in O
more O
detail O
, O
let O
's O
say O
, O
the O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
in O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
, O
their O
material O
life O
will O
no O
doubt O
be O
a O
lot O
less O
taken O
care O
of O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
usual O
both O
parents O
or O
one O
parent O
at O
home O
situation O
. O

This O
is O
indisputable O
. O

This O
type O
of O
family O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
others O
. O

We O
had O
an O
example O
of O
a O
child O
in O
Shaanxi B-GPE
province I-GPE
. O

Um O
, O
there O
was O
a O
family O
! O

This O
family O
had O
an O
older O
brother O
and O
a O
younger O
sister O
. O

Both O
parents O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
to O
work O
. O

The O
father O
went O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
and O
later O
the O
mother O
wanted O
to O
go O
, O
too O
. O

What O
happened O
to O
these O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
? O

The O
grandparents O
were O
unwilling O
to O
take O
care O
of O
them O
because O
in O
rural O
areas O
, O
grandparents O
also O
have O
to O
work O
in O
the O
field O
! O

As O
a O
result O
, O
, O
this O
mother O
sent O
, O
these O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
to O
martial O
arts O
school O
to O
study O
. O

After O
they O
went O
to O
the O
martial O
arts O
school O
for O
a O
while O
, O
um O
, O
their O
mother O
was O
, O
um O
, O
a O
little O
worried O
, O
so O
she O
went O
to O
visit O
them O
. O

She O
went O
to O
visit O
them O
. O

When O
she O
saw O
them O
, O
, O
the O
girl O
cried O
to O
her O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
stay O
here O
. O

I O
want O
to O
go O
home O
. O
" O

Later O
, O
the O
mother O
was O
moved O
and O
brought O
, O
this O
girl O
home O
and O
had O
the O
grandparents O
look O
after O
her O
. O

Um O
, O
she O
still O
, O
ai O
, O
left O
him O
at O
the O
martial O
arts O
school O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
after O
the O
girl O
returned O
, O
the O
mother O
continued O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

When O
she O
came O
back O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
in O
between O
work O
, O
she O
found O
that O
the O
girl O
's O
body O
was O
dotted O
with O
red O
marks O
and O
red O
swellings O
. O

She O
then O
discovered O
ah O
, O
um O
, O
the O
grandparents O
had O
not O
washed O
her O
clothes O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O

The O
situation O
you O
mentioned O
, O
is O
it O
common O
or O
is O
it O
a O
rather O
extreme O
example O
, O
because O
generally O
, O
people O
will O
think O
that O
grandparents O
will O
particularly O
love O
and O
care O
about O
their O
grandchildren O
? O

The O
situation O
that O
I O
just O
mentioned O
regarding O
skip O
- O
generation O
custody O
is O
no O
doubt O
common O
. O

Why O
is O
it O
so O
? O

You O
said O
that O
grandparents O
certainly O
have O
special O
love O
for O
the O
children O
. O

It O
is O
true O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
they O
will O
go O
out O
of O
their O
way O
to O
pamper O
the O
children O
. O

However O
, O
for O
the O
elderly O
, O
with O
the O
difference O
in O
age O
and O
time O
, O
, O
their O
, O
ways O
of O
taking O
care O
and O
loving O
the O
children O
are O
different O
. O

They O
are O
influenced O
by O
their O
own O
habits O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
there O
was O
a O
child O
who O
was O
sick O
. O

Um O
, O
the O
grandparents O
asked O
him O
to O
take O
, O
a O
small O
pill O
that O
was O
made O
in O
Shaanxi B-GPE
. O

They O
did O
not O
even O
know O
what O
it O
was O
made O
of O
. O

It O
was O
a O
local O
method O
. O

Um O
, O
after O
all O
, O
they O
are O
different O
from O
, O
um O
, O
young O
people O
in O
this O
respect O
. O

Instead O
of O
sending O
the O
child O
to O
the O
hospital O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
, O
they O
are O
influenced O
by O
, O
some O
habits O
in O
this O
aspect O
. O

, O
they O
raised O
this O
point O
themselves O
. O

Another O
important O
point O
they O
mentioned O
was O
that O
they O
had O
to O
take O
care O
of O
the O
entire O
family O
. O

" O
Her O
father O
and O
mother O
are O
not O
home O
, O
so O
the O
entire O
family O
falls O
onto O
our O
shoulders O
, O
especially O
when O
we O
still O
have O
to O
be O
responsible O
for O
the O
farm O
work O
on O
the O
farmland O
. O

So O
, O
all O
I O
can O
do O
is O
to O
feed O
her O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
she O
is O
not O
cold O
. O
" O

They O
also O
had O
to O
face O
such O
a O
reality O
, O
one O
that O
they O
could O
not O
resolve O
. O

After O
all O
, O
a O
family O
that O
had O
so O
many O
people O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
, O
the O
parents O
of O
the O
children O
were O
a O
very O
important O
um O
, O
workforce O
. O

Now O
it O
was O
down O
to O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
grandparents O
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
they O
could O
not O
help O
. O



In O
the O
study O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
many O
staff O
found O
out O
by O
surprise O
that O
the O
biological O
cycle O
of O
the O
farmers O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
and O
the O
inculcation O
and O
upbringing O
cycle O
of O
their O
children O
, O
have O
formed O
two B-CARDINAL
parallel O
lines O
that O
will O
never O
meet O
. O

Farmers O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
are O
generally O
a O
young O
workforce O
in O
their O
prime O
, O
while O
this O
is O
the O
period O
in O
which O
their O
children O
attend O
primary O
or O
junior O
high O
school O
. O

Originally O
, O
they O
work O
in O
the O
city O
out O
of O
the O
hope O
that O
their O
children O
can O
receive O
a O
better O
education O
. O

However O
, O
adolescent O
children O
need O
the O
loving O
care O
and O
guidance O
of O
their O
parents O
even O
more O
. O

During O
this O
period O
, O
the O
absence O
of O
both O
or O
even O
one O
parent O
will O
create O
obstacles O
to O
the O
character O
development O
of O
the O
children O
. O

This O
pair O
of O
unavoidable O
contradictions O
has O
made O
the O
problem O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
in O
rural O
areas O
become O
more O
obvious O
. O

You O
have O
seen O
many O
kinds O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
. O

Was O
there O
a O
particular O
case O
or O
a O
particular O
child O
who O
had O
left O
an O
especially O
deep O
impression O
on O
you O
that O
you O
still O
remember O
now O
? O

, O
um O
, O
there O
was O
a O
child O
in O
Ningxia B-GPE
whose O
name O
was O
Yao B-PERSON
Zhengang I-PERSON
. O

This O
child O
, O
um O
, O
did O
not O
do O
exceptionally O
well O
in O
school O
. O

What O
impressed O
me O
the O
most O
about O
him O
was O
that O
he O
really O
missed O
his O
parents O
. O

He O
felt O
particularly O
lonely O
and O
especially O
wanted O
his O
father O
to O
come O
back O
. O

He O
said O
that O
he O
was O
sick O
one B-CARDINAL
time O
. O

His O
father O
worked O
in O
Guyuan B-GPE
, O
about O
40 B-QUANTITY
to I-QUANTITY
50 I-QUANTITY
kilometers I-QUANTITY
away O
from O
home O
. O

After O
his O
father O
learned O
that O
he O
was O
very O
sick O
, O
he O
ran O
back O
to O
the O
village O
right O
away O
. O

After O
he O
arrived O
at O
the O
village O
, O
he O
did O
not O
say O
anything O
, O
but O
to O
put O
him O
on O
his O
back O
and O
carry O
him O
to O
the O
town O
to O
see O
a O
doctor O
. O

He O
just O
carried O
him O
like O
that O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
. O

When O
the O
doctor O
in O
the O
town O
took O
a O
look O
and O
told O
him O
that O
they O
were O
unable O
to O
cure O
the O
sickness O
, O
he O
carried O
the O
child O
to O
the O
county O
. O

When O
Yao B-PERSON
Zhengang I-PERSON
told O
us O
what O
happened O
, O
he O
said O
, O
" O
My O
father O
had O
never O
bought O
me O
so O
many O
tasty O
foods O
before O
. O

On O
that B-DATE
day I-DATE
, O
he O
bought O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
tasty O
food O
while O
we O
were O
in O
the O
county O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
eat O
any O
himself O
. O
" O

I O
thought O
about O
this O
at O
that O
time O
. O

After O
I O
heard O
this O
incident O
, O
I O
particularly O
understood O
what O
was O
in O
the O
mind O
of O
Yao B-PERSON
Zhengang I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
father O
. O

He O
might O
have O
felt O
especially O
guilty O
toward O
his O
child O
. O

What O
he O
felt O
was O
that O
" O
I O
go O
out O
to O
work O
and O
leave O
my O
child O
home O
. O
" O

He O
said O
that O
his O
child O
had O
also O
said O
, O
" O
When O
he O
was O
at O
home O
, O
he O
always O
encouraged O
me O
. O
" O

He O
would O
say O
, O
" O
No O
problem O
. O
You O
work O
hard O
and O
get O
a O
better O
grade O
next O
time O
, O
" O
when O
I O
had O
low O
grades O
. O

If O
he O
could O
receive O
many O
, O
such O
encouragements O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
um O
, O
um O
, O
disliked O
school O
sometimes O
. O

He O
does O
not O
want O
to O
go O
to O
school O
now O
. O

However O
, O
in O
his O
example O
, O
I O
could O
imagine O
what O
went O
through O
his O
father O
's O
mind O
at O
that O
time O
. O

I O
think O
that O
he O
felt O
very O
guilty O
toward O
his O
child O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
can O
feel O
that O
um O
, O
um O
, O
parents O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
also O
have O
no O
alternative O
. O

They O
are O
forced O
into O
making O
such O
decisions O
. O

Um O
, O
there O
was O
also O
this O
child O
. O

There O
was O
a O
child O
, O
a O
girl O
in O
Xixiang B-GPE
county I-GPE
, O
Shaanxi B-GPE
province I-GPE
. O

Um O
, O
when O
I O
asked O
, O
" O
What O
do O
you O
think O
are O
the O
changes O
that O
your O
parents O
working O
in O
the O
city O
have O
caused O
you O
? O
" O
She O
did O
not O
answer O
. O

She O
went O
home O
to O
get O
a O
small O
box O
. O

There O
was O
a O
small O
finger O
inside O
the O
box O
. O

This O
was O
a O
very O
terrifying O
incident O
. O

What O
was O
the O
small O
finger O
all O
about O
? O

What O
happened O
was O
that O
when O
her O
um O
, O
parents O
left O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
her O
grandparents O
looked O
after O
her O
. O

They O
had O
a O
cellar O
at O
home O
and O
inside O
was O
a O
hay O
cutter O
for O
cutting O
hay O
. O

When O
she O
went O
downstairs O
to O
play O
by O
herself O
, O
an O
accident O
happened O
. O

Her O
grandparents O
said O
, O
" O
We O
ca O
n't O
help O
. O

We O
ca O
n't O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
her O
all O
the O

" O

, O
before O
they O
went O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
they O
could O
watch O
her O
and O
forbade O
her O
to O
go O
down O
to O
the O
cellar O
. O

He O
had O
told O
her O
not O
to O
do O
that O
before O
. O

However O
, O
I O
said O
that O
sometimes O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
ask O
children O
to O
have O
self O
control O
. O

That O
was O
why O
she O

The O
only O
connection O
that O

now O
is O
to O
talk O

once O
a O

. O

In O
his O
opinion O

is O
something O

How O
often O
can O
your O

you O
? O

Uh O
, O
once O
a O

! O

What O
do O
you O
talk O
about O
? O

I O
will O
talk O
about O
my O
studies O

life O
. O

My O
schoolwork O
was O
not O
quite O
good O
when O
I O
first B-ORDINAL
came O
! O

My O
mother O
scolded O
me O
in O
the O
beginning O
when O
my O
schoolwork O
was O
poor O
. O

She O
said O
that O
I O
was O
losing O
honor O
for O
not O
doing O
well O
at O
school O
! O

Then O
I O
cried O
and O
after O
that O
, O
my O
mother O
cried O
, O
too O
. O

Since O
they O
move O
from O

in O
the O

work O
all O

parents O
of O
left O

little O
communication O

their O

While O
for O
temporary O
custodians O
, O
they O
are O
only O
limited O

providing O
superficial O
care O

such O
as O
making O
sure O
the O
children O
have O
food O

stay O
warm O
, O
but O
can O
not O
fulfill O
the O
responsibility O

educating O
the O
children O

The O

found O

36.7 B-PERCENT

I O

the O

choose O

Why O
do O
they O
do O
that O
? O

It O
is O
because O
they O
are O
afraid O
that O
their O

I O

Why O
do O
you O

It O
is O
because O
I O
care O
about O
my O

very O
much O
. O

I O
think O
about O
their O

I O
know O
that O
they O
work O
in O
the O

because O
of O

so O
I O
care O
about O
them O
a O
lot O

They O
will O
be O
worn O
out O
from O

the O

working O
in O
the O

make O

I O
believe O
it O
is O
also O

, O
so O
I O
care O
about O
their O
health O
a O
lot O

you O
, O
why O
is O
it O
because O
of O
you O
? O

Because O
if O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
me O
, O
I O
think O
they O
uh O
, O
would O
be O
a O
lot O
more O
, O
relaxed O
when O
they O
worked O
. O



Then O
, O
are O
these O
children O
willing O
to O
live O
with O
their O
parents O
? O
Or O
go O
to O
the O
city O
with O
them O
? O

In O
regard O
to O
this O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
, O
, O
children O
all O
want O
their O
parents O
to O
come O
back O
to O
live O
with O
them O
. O

However O
, O
51 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
children O
we O
surveyed O
were O
unwilling O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
with O
their O
parents O
, O
go O
to O
the O
city O
, O
to O
live O
in O
the O
city O
. O

However O
, O
they O
all O
wanted O
their O
parents O
to O
come O
back O
, O
but O
half B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
children O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O

We O
also O
asked O
them O
why O
they O
did O
not O
want O
to O
go O
to O
the O
city O
. O

This O
was O
also O
very O
surprising O
to O
us O
. O

They O
said O
that O
the O
city O
is O
another O
world O
and O
they O
were O
especially O
worried O
. O

They O
were O
afraid O
that O
once O
they O
go O
to O
the O
city O
, O
they O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
assimilate O
into O
the O
schools O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

Second B-ORDINAL
, O
they O
realized O
that O
it O
is O
already O
a O
very O
difficult O
task O
for O
their O
parents O
to O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

Their O
parents O
have O
to O
send O
money O
home O
, O
among O
other O
things O
. O

If O
they O
go O
live O
with O
them O
, O
they O
will O
add O
more O
burdens O
to O
their O
parents O
. O

If O
we O
are O
in O
the O
city O
every O
day O
, O
live O
in O
the O
city O
every O
day O
, O
we O
may O
know O
that O
oh O
, O
city O
life O
is O
like O
this O
. O

As O
for O
children O
from O
rural O
areas O
and O
people O
from O
rural O
areas O
who O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
they O
are O
not O
familiar O
with O
this O
world O
and O
they O
have O
a O
type O
of O
fear O
. O

As O
for O
parents O
, O
are O
they O
more O
willing O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
with O
them O
or O
leave O
them O
at O
home O
? O

I O
believe O
when O
parents O
make O
this O
decision O
, O
their O
main O
consideration O
is O
not O
willing O
or O
unwilling O
. O

All O
parents O
, O
I O
can O
say O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
parents O
, O
definitely O
want O
to O
live O
with O
their O
children O
. O

However O
, O
with O
the O
reality O
that O
they O
have O
to O
face O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
they O
can O
not O
solve O
this O
problem O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
we O
know O
what O
the O
reality O
is O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
, O
their O
families O
are O
rather O
poor O
to O
begin O
with O
. O

Only O
the O
lower O
- O
middle O
class O
will O
leave O
the O
rural O
areas O
and O
work O
in O
the O
city O
. O

They O
have O
to O
make O
money O
to O
support O
the O
family O
. O

They O
will O
need O
a O
huge O
sum O
of O
money O
in O
order O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
to O
the O
city O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
I O
believe O
there O
are O
also O
many O
other O
reasons O
. O

They O
also O
have O
to O
consider O
whether O
their O
children O
can O
go O
to O
school O
in O
the O
city O
. O

They O
have O
to O
find O
a O
place O
to O
live O
. O

All O
these O
are O
problems O
that O
they O
need O
to O
resolve O
. O

The O
problems O
they O
face O
are O
too O
many O
. O

If O
the O
children O
go O
to O
the O
city O
, O
the O
expenses O
will O
be O
very O
high O
. O

Since O
circumstances O
do O
not O
permit O
, O
they O
can O
not O
bring O
their O
children O
with O
them O
, O
according O
to O
their O
will O
or O
their O
psychological O
need O
. O

Many O
parents O
are O
unable O
to O
bring O
their O
children O
with O
them O
. O

What O
would O
you O
tell O
your O
parents O
if O
you O
could O
see O
them O
now O
? O

I O
want O
to O
tell O
them O
that O
I O
miss O
them O
very O
much O
. O



Judging O
from O
the O
surface O
, O
is O
there O
any O
obvious O
difference O
between O
the O
character O
of O
these O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
and O
non-left O
- O
behind O
children O
? O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
tell O
from O
the O
surface O
. O

Why O
is O
it O
so O
? O

For O
these O
children O
, O
it O
depends O
on O
how O
long O
their O
parents O
have O
been O
working O
in O
the O
city O
. O

For O
example O
, O
some O
have O
just O
gone O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
while O
others O
have O
gone O
for O
10 B-DATE
years I-DATE
already O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
um O
, O
generally O
speaking O
, O
uh O
, O
we O
did O
not O
conduct O
any O
psychological O
testing O
or O
comparison O
in O
this O
psychological O
aspect O
. O

However O
, O
many O
schools O
and O
custodians O
reported O
that O
many O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
had O
become O
very O
withdrawn O
. O

They O
had O
very O
strange O
um O
, O
um O
, O
temperaments O
. O

They O
did O
not O
like O
to O
speak O
. O

There O
was O
, O
a O
child O
who O
was O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
year I-DATE
of O
junior O
high O
school O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
he O
told O
us O
himself O
that O
he O
particularly O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
misses O
his O
father O
. O

He O
was O
very O
good O
at O
school O
. O

However O
, O
one O
time O
we O
visited O
him O
, O
his O
um O
, O
family O
told O
us O
that O
he O
was O
second B-ORDINAL
in O
his O
class O
in O
his O
examination O
. O

After O
that O
, O
he O
became O
extremely O
, O
extremely O
, O
annoyed O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
his O
language O
and O
other O
things O
became O
very O
strange O
. O

Um O
, O
um O
, O
we O
also O
asked O
his O
um O
, O
um O
, O
grandparents O
who O
had O
custody O
of O
him O
. O

They O
said O
that O
when O
his O
father O
was O
home O
, O
he O
would O
always O
encourage O
him O
and O
um O
, O
exchange O
with O
him O
. O

Um O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
was O
not O
necessarily O
because O
his O
parents O
worked O
in O
the O
city O
. O

However O
, O
for O
some O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
their O
parents O
working O
in O
the O
city O
has O
caused O
some O
psychological O
abnormalities O
and O
unusual O
development O
. O

This O
situation O
indeed O
exists O
. O

After O
all O
, O
these O
are O
families O
whose O
love O
is O
inadequate O
and O
incomplete O
. O

I O
believe O
love O
is O
especially O
important O
. O

Children O
need O
love O
from O
the O
time O
they O
are O
small O
. O

We O
have O
to O
understand O
our O
Chinese B-NORP
saying O
, O
" O
The O
child O
is O
father O
to O
the O
man O
. O
" O

What O
it O
says O
is O
that O
the O
character O
that O
children O
form O
at O
a O
very O
young O
age O
will O
affect O
their O
entire O
life O
. O

Only O
children O
who O
are O
loved O
and O
who O
realize O
the O
importance O
of O
love O
since O
they O
are O
young O
will O
be O
able O
to O
love O
other O
people O
in O
the O
future O
. O

This O
is O
the O
case O
. O

Therefore O
, O
for O
this O
type O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
um O
, O
this O
group O
of O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
, O
psychologically O
, O
they O
do O
not O
have O
family O
love O
. O

Um O
, O
, O
if O
the O
parents O
work O
in O
the O
city O
, O
these O
children O
perhaps O
will O
not O
receive O
timely O
attention O
when O
they O
encounter O
many O
difficulties O
at O
home O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
neighbors O
around O
are O
all O
facing O
different O
realities O
and O
can O
not O
offer O
them O
timely O
love O
. O

Under O
this O
situation O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
, O
um O
, O
I O
am O
unwilling O
to O
imagine O
what O
mentality O
and O
character O
these O
children O
will O
develop O
when O
they O
grow O
up O
. O

Will O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
love O
in O
society O
or O
not O
? O

Will O
they O
think O
that O
love O
is O
important O
in O
society O
or O
not O
, O
because O
they O
have O
never O
experienced O
it O
. O

They O
have O
never O
completely O
experienced O
it O
. O

Thus O
, O
if O
such O
a O
large O
group O
in O
society O
does O
not O
realize O
that O
love O
should O
be O
, O
um O
, O
given O
or O
received O
in O
society O
, O
I O
think O
this O
is O
, O
something O
that O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
imagine O
. O

Despite O
the O
guarantee O
in O
food O
, O
clothing O
, O
and O
school O
that O
left O

behind O
children O
get O
because O
their O

the O
psychological O
and O
physiological O
satisfaction O
that O
they O
require O
. O

According O
to O
the O
survey O
, O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
of O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
were O
dissatisfied O
with O
their O
current O
life O
. O

58 B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
the O
left O
- O
behind O
children O
believed O
that O
they O
were O
unhappy O
. O

Are O
the O
parents O
worried O
about O
leaving O
their O
children O
at O
home O
by O
themselves O
? O

Do O
they O
understand O
the O
living O
conditions O
of O
their O
children O
at O
home O
? O

They O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
a O
reality O
that O
they O
could O
not O
um O
, O
um O
, O
face O
. O

They O
were O
condemned O
to O
this O
reality O
. O

No O
doubt O
, O
I O
think O
some O
, O
um O
, O
parents O
have O
not O
had O
such O
profound O
consideration O
. O

Why O
do O
n't O
they O
? O

I O
believe O
people O
are O
all O
the O
same O
. O

If O
they O
face O
such O
an O
urgent O
need O
for O
a O
livelihood O
, O
their O
first B-ORDINAL
consideration O
will O
be O
the O
need O
for O
a O
livelihood O
. O

They O
can O
not O
consider O
the O
deeper O
issue O
of O
children O
's O
safety O
and O
psychology O
when O
their O
livelihood O
has O
not O
been O
solved O
, O
satisfied O
, O
and O
guaranteed O
. O

For O
example O
, O
there O
were O
two B-CARDINAL
sisters O
who O
lived O
in O
a O
cave O
dwelling O
in O
Shaanxi B-GPE
province I-GPE
. O

Many O
people O
whom O
we O
interviewed O
lived O
in O
cave O
dwellings O
. O

Once O
there O
was O
a O
flood O
. O

, O
these O
sisters O
stayed O
in O
the O
cave O
dwelling O
to O
look O
after O
the O
home O
! O

This O
happened O
in O
the O
rural O
area O
. O

These O
two B-CARDINAL
children O
were O
looking O
after O
the O
home O
. O

Their O
uncle O
saved O
them O
when O
the O
flood O
was O
almost O
past O
their O
bellies O
. O

Their O
father O
called O
later O
to O
see O
if O
they O
were O
fine O
. O

The O
family O
told O
him O
that O
they O
were O
fine O
. O

He O
did O
not O
come O
back O
after O
that O
. O

He O
did O
not O
come O
back O
to O
check O
if O
everything O
was O
fine O
. O

I O
believe O
the O
reason O
he O
did O
not O
return O
was O
that O
he O
would O
ponder O
whether O
he O
should O
return O
or O
not O
. O




But O
%um O
, O
guessed O
what O
happened O
. O

What O
? O

%um O
The O
%um O

But O
, O
I O
do O

really O
like O
going O

Marie I-PERSON
because O
she O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
. O

Why O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

She O
kind O
of O
, O

well O
unfortunately O
for O
some O
reason O
she O
's O
not O
like O
into O
cardio O
vascular O
. O

So O
when O
I O
'm O
still O
riding O
the O
bike O
she O
's O
completely O
finished O
her O
weight O
lifting O
routine O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
like O
I O
have O
n't O
even O
started O
mine O
. O
mhm O
. O
You O
know O

and O
I O
kind O
of O
hinted O
to O
her O
that O
really O
the O
only O
way O
to O
lose O
weight O
is O
cardio O
vascular O
. O
mhm O
. O
It O
's O
true O
. O
And O
that O
lifting O
the O
weights O
wo O
n't O
lose O
weight O
. O

%mm O
%mm O
. O

You O
wo O
n't O
lose O
it O
, O
you O
know O
, O

but O

No O

I O
mean O
you O
might O
lose O
some O

but O
that O
's O
only O
when O
yo- O
. O

For O
a O
woman O
who O
is O
lifting O
not O
that O
much O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
yeah O
. O
You O
would O
. O

I O
mean O
yeah O

I O
mean O
the O
only O
thing O
is O
%um O
just O
getting O
your O
heart O
rate O
up O
for O
extended O
periods O
of O
time O
. O

yeah O
, O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

maybe O
she O
'll O
catch O
on O
soon O
. O

You O
do O
burn O
a O
lot O
of O
calories O
an O
hour O
though O
, O
lifting O
weights O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%uh O

yeah O

I O
mean O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
lose O
that O
much O
. O

and O
also O
lifting O
weights O
at O
Bally B-FAC
's I-FAC
means O
you O
're O
standing O
on O
line O
for O
as O
much O
time O
as O
you O
're O
actually O
lifting O
. O

Really O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O
too O
bad O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
is O
it O
really O
overcrowded O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
obviously O
since O
I O
work O
I O
ca O
n't O
get O
there O
until O
about B-TIME
six I-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
at O
night O
which O
is O
when O
everyone O
else O
gets O
there O
. O

mhm O
. O

mhm O
. O

But O
I O
'm O
sure O
for O
people O
who O
go O
in O
the B-TIME
daytime I-TIME
it O
's O
probably O
dead O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O

and O
%um O
, O
like O
when O
I O
go O
Saturday B-TIME
and I-TIME
Sunday I-TIME
mornings I-TIME

's O
totally O
dead O

and O
he O

two I-DATE
days I-DATE
. O

Really O
? O

yeah O
. O

Wow O
. O

He O
eats O
at O
least O
like O
four B-CARDINAL
of O
cereal O
a O
day O
like O
in O
addition O
to O
like O
meals O
. O

uh-huh O

And O
when O
he O
goes O
to O
work O
he O
brings O
four B-CARDINAL
sandwiches O
with O
him O

mad O
. O

Really O

I O
would O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
going O
. O

I O
was O
not O
invited O
. O
mhm O
. O
You O

well O
you O

a O

is O
open O

everyone O
. O

I O
was O
like O
well O
that O
's O
fine O

but O
I O
would O
not O
feel O
comfortable O
going O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
think O
that O
would O
be O
obnoxious O

and O
I O
think O
they O
would O
then O
feel O
guilty O
for O
not O
inviting O
me O
. O

Right O
. O

To O
-- O
-- O
you O
know O
the O
other O
thing O
, O
the O
reception O
. O

I O
just O
would O
n't O
go O
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
they O
had O
to O
take O
it O
down O
and O
drive O
her O
home O
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
they O
're O
always O
kind O
of O
pissy O
at O
me O
. O

%mm O
. O
That O
's O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
I O
've O
been O
thinking O
about O
it O

and O
the O
black O
's O
not O
going O

be O
so O
hot O
you O

. O



Apparently O
they O
were O
also O
carrying O
lillies O
which O
is O
kind O
of O
goofy O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
guess O
she O
did O
that O
because O
someone O
suggested O
that O
to O
her O
because O
you O
know O
the O
lillies O
the O
symbol O
of O
the O
virgin O
Mary B-PERSON
. O

mhm O
. O

White O
lillies O
? O

lillies O
and O
black O

funeral O

and O
she O
had O
to O
keep O
reminding O
herself O

They O

now O
living O

And O
she O
's O
teaching O
at O
U B-ORG
R I-ORG
I I-ORG
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
it O
was O
a O
very O
nice O
letter O
, O
because O
it O
sounded O
like O
she O
went O
through O
very O
similar O
things O
that O
I O
did O
. O

You O
know O
, O
I O
went O
from O
Chicago B-GPE

U B-ORG
C I-ORG
S I-ORG
G I-ORG
to O
here O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
it O
's O
just O
such O
an O
intellectual O
letdown O
. O

Right O
. O

And O
she O
went O
from O
Penn B-ORG
, O
%um O
To O
Columbia B-ORG
. O
to O
Columbia B-ORG
to O
U B-ORG
R I-ORG
I I-ORG
. O

Well O
Columbia B-ORG
's O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
she O
said O
the O
students O
are O
just O
, O

you O
know O
, O
they O
do O
n't O
care O
, O

and O
they O
're O
not O
very O
good O
, O

and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
she O
's O
getting O
conference O
papers O
rejected O

and O
she O
thinks O
it O
's O
the O
affiliation O
. O

yeah O
. O

Because O
she O
does O
n't O
think O
the O
quality O
of O
her O
work O
has O
changed O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
n't O
submitted O
a O
conference O
paper O
with O
the O
Missouri B-ORG
%um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
affiliation O
yet O
. O

Because O
the O
last O
one O
I O
submitted O
, O
%um O
, O
was O
in O
the O
fall O
, O

and O
I O
still O
had O
my O
San B-ORG
Diego I-ORG
affiliation O
. O

yeah O
. O

%um O
, O
in O
fact O
I O
'm O
still O
officially O
on O
leave O
. O

If O
anything O
came O
up O
in O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
we O
could O
still O
go O

%uh O
you O
know O
, O
for O
Sam B-PERSON
. O

Wow O
. O

But O
I O
think O
it O
's O
very O
very O
very O
very O
yeah O
. O
unlikely O
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
at O
any O
rate O
it O
was O
nice O
to O
hear O
from O
her O
because O
she O
said O
after B-DATE
two I-DATE
years I-DATE
there O
now O
, O
she O
%um O
has O
come O
to O

, O

and O
yeah O
. O
she O
's O
accepted O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
things O
in O
Rhode B-GPE
Island I-GPE
. O

And O
, O
%um O
, O
you O
know O
, O
their O
life O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
complicated O
, O

and O
she O
has O
more O
time O
to O
be O
a O
parent O
. O

yeah O
. O

Good O
. O

And O
she O
's O
just O
not O
going O
to O
have O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
career O
that O
she O
had O
thought O
about O
. O

Ron B-PERSON

. O
that O
fast O
each O
time O

he O
was O
diagnosed O

%um O
Tufts B-ORG
thing O
that O
Ginny B-PERSON
Totta I-PERSON
you O
know O
in O
the O

So O
, O
anyway O
, O
how O
are O
you O
doing O
these O
days O
? O

Things O
are O
going O
very O
well O
. O

I O
think O
I O
had O
mentioned O
before O
%uh O
, O
that O
there O
's O
a O
company O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
working O
with O
%um O
, O
%uh O
, O
which O
is O
very O
much O
just O
myself O
and O
Guss B-PERSON
. O

oh O
. O

And O
that O
%um O

No O
, O
you O
had O
n't O
mentioned O
that O
. O

%eh O
, O
oh O
, O
okay O
. O

okay O
, O
so O
%um O

%eh O
you O
told O
me O
that O
you O
were O
leaving O
the O
company O
that O
you O
were O
at O
, O

and O
you O
were O
entertaining O
offers O
. O

And O
, O
%uh O

well O
it O
seemed O
to O
make O
sense O
since O
I O
had O
a O
client O
to O
just O
kind O
of O
set O
up O
my O
own O
company O
, O
of O
sorts O
. O

%um O
oh O
. O
So O
things O
are O
going O
extremely O
well O
. O

So O
, O
I O
had O
one O
client O
who O
said O
that O
he O
'd O
pay O
me O
a O
minimum O
amount O
. O

You O
know O
, O
he O
, O
%uh O
, O

there O
would O
be O
a O
minimum O
amount O
of O
work O
, O
of O
about O
%uh O
, O
a O
day O
a O
week O
for O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
two I-DATE
three I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O
mhm O
. O
Which O
is O
sufficient O
to O
pay O
all O
my O
bills O
then O

so O
I O
decided O
that O
it O
would O
make O
sense O
to O
do O
this O
. O

%um O
and O
, O
%um O
, O
I O
've O
been O
getting O
substantially O
more O
work O
than O
then O
. O

%mm O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
quite O
pleased O
. O

Well O
that O
's O
good O
. O

%um O
, O
so O
I O
have O
a O
bunch O
of O
%uh O
work O
that O
I O
need O
to O
do O
on O
my O
flat O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

I O
've O
been O
telling O
you O
that O
I O
needed O
to O
do O
that O
roof O
atrium O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
. O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
it O
should O
come O
out O
this B-DATE
year I-DATE
. O

oh O
, O
well O
that O
's O
good O
. O

It O
should O
be O
done O
in O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
months I-DATE
. O

oh O
, O
yeah O

I O
remember O
So O
you O
talking O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
it O
at O
one O
point O
. O

yeah O
, O

yeah O
. O

So O
you O
have O
no O
intentions O
of O
coming O
over O
this O
way O
any O
time O
soon O
? O

%um O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
see O
the O
finances O
occurring O
uh-huh O
, O
right O
. O
for O
a O
while O
. O

%um O
, O
actually O
right O
at O
the O
moment O
finances O
are O
not O
going O
real O
well O
. O

But O
%ah O
well O
. O
I O
am O
working O
on O
that O
one O
. O

%uh O
. O

It O
's O
just O
But O
%um O
%uh O
, O
%uh O
, O
the O
main O
reason O
for O
that O
is O
I O
had O
not O
really O
anticipated O
a O
few O
expenses O
that O
recently O
came O
up O
%ah O
. O
%uh O
, O
related O
to O
a O
couple O
of O
burglaries O
that O
I O
had O
. O

oh O
, O
harsh O
. O
Harsh O
. O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
, O

and O
. O

Not O
a O
whole O
lot O
I O
can O
do O
about O
that O
now O
. O

Indeed O
. O
Indeed O
. O

have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
situation O
. O

And O

So O
that O
's O
what O
I O
'm O
doing O
. O

Sounds O
good O
. O

But O
%um O
Anyway O
, O
%uh O
One B-CARDINAL
of O
the O
main O
reasons O
that O
I O
've O
been O
such O
a O
pathetic O
, O
%uh O
, O
correspondent O
has O
been O
work O
. O

I O
've O
actually O
been O
doing O
a O
lot O
of O
it O
. O

oh O
wow O
. O



And O
%uh O
, O
I O
turned O
in O
my O
Master O
's O
thesis O
back O
in O
May B-DATE
, O

and O
I O
'm O
actually O
presently O
working O
on O
, O
%um O
, O
several O
, O
%uh O
, O
articles O
oh O
, O
okay O
. O
Impressive O
. O
from O
it O
. O

yeah O
, O

actually O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
little O
bit O
in O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
, O
%uh O
, O
is O
going O
to O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
very O
important O
in O
the O
end O
. O
%uh O
, O
from O
what O
I O
had O
been O
reading O
in O
the O
literature O
. O

You O
see O
the O
one O
very O
annoying O
thing O
about O
all O
of O
this O
, O
was O
my O
advisor O
has O
been O
in O
France B-GPE
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half I-DATE
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
this O
made O
writing O
my O
thesis O
very O
annoying O
because O
you O
know O
there O
was O
n't O
much O
discussion O
. O

yeah O
. O

yup O
, O

yup O
. O

But O
, O
%um O
Anyway O
, O
I O
had O
been O
kind O
of O
telling O
him O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
from O
my O
reading O
of O
the O
literature O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
this O
one B-CARDINAL
little O
alteration O
I O
had O
made O
in O
my O
model O
was O
kind O
of O
clever O
and O
unique O
. O

mhm O
. O

And O
it O
made O
the O
one B-CARDINAL
type O
of O
solution O
occur O
, O
which O
was O
seen O
experimentally O
, O

but O
none O
of O
the O
other O
models O
%uh O
, O
had O
? O

Yes O
. O

the- O
, O

I O
'm O
looking O
at O
, O
%um O
, O
multi O
mode O
lasers O
. O

And O
one O
of O
the O
things O
that O
they O
find O
experimentally O
are O
what O
they O
call O
anti O
phased O
, O
%uh O
, O
states O
, O
where O
if O
you O
look O
at O
the O
total O
intensity O
uh-huh O
. O
of O
the O
laser O
, O
you O
get O
an O
oscillation O
which O
is O
characterized O
by O
one B-CARDINAL
frequency O
. O

Yes O
. O

okay O
. O

if O
you O
separate O
out O
the O
different O
modes O
of O
the O
laser O
mhm O
. O
and O
look O
at O
one O
of O
those O
, O
you O
get O
more B-CARDINAL
than I-CARDINAL
one I-CARDINAL
frequency O
. O

okay O
. O

So O
what O
's O
happening O
is O
that O
the O
modes O
are O
oscillating O
out O
of O
phase O
so O
that O
they O
completely O
mask O
each O
other O
's O
Exactly O
. O
%hm O
. O
oscillations O
on O
these O
other O
frequencies O
. O

And O
%uh O
With O
a O
pretty O
simple O
model O
you O
can O
find O
that O
frequency O
in O
a O
transient O
, O

but O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
that O
frequency O
in O
a O
driven O
, O
%uh O
, O
frequency O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
find O
so O
that O
it O
will O
sustain O
. O

okay O
. O

Yes O
. O

So O
yeah O
, O
that O
particular O
frequency O
according O
to O
most O
models O
damps O
out O
very O
quickly O
. O

And O
so O
you O
should O
n't O
actually O
really O
be O
able O
to O
ever O
see O
it O
. O

%hm O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
, O
that O
, O
when O
you O
do O
the O
experiment O
you O
see O
it O
. O

Got O
it O
, O

got O
it O
. O

I O
see O
. O

So O
, O
%um O
, O
I O
found O
a O
simple O
modification O
of O
the O
original O
formula O
, O
which O
unfortunately O
makes O
the O
solutions O
horrendously O
nasty O
. O
And O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
%uh O
, O
insoluble O
. O

But O
yeah O
. O
it O
gives O
a O
driving O
term O
. O

oh O
, O
okay O
. O

So O
, O
it O
actually O
creates O
a O
situation O
where O
you O
get O
the O
right O
sort O
of O
answer O
, O
you O
just O
ca O
n't O
always O
write O
it O
down O
very O
easily O
. O

Exactly O
. O

oh O
wow O
. O

so O
you O
're O
pushing O
forward O
the O
bounds O
of O
theoretical O
laser O
, O
%uh O
, O
whatever O
it O
is O
science O
. O

But O

which O
, O
%um O
, O
is O
kind O
of O
interesting O
considering O
that O
that O
's O
not O
really O
my O
thing O
. O
. O
Indeed O
. O
Indeed O
. O
being O
an O
experimentalist O
, O
not O
a O
theorist O
. O

%um O
Indeed O
. O
oh O
wow O
. O
oh O
, O
impressive O
. O
But O

so O
are O
you O
going O
to O
get O
an O
article O
in O
Nature B-ORG
or O
something O
? O

%um O
, O
actually O
, O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
we O
're O
shooting O
for O
op- O
, O

I O
think O
Optics B-ORG
Letters I-ORG
is O
probably O
the O
one O
that O
we O
're O
shooting O
for O
, O
or O
else O
, O
perhaps O
, O
though O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
it O
's O
quite O
that O
significant O
, O
would O
be O
Phys B-ORG
Rev I-ORG
Letters I-ORG
. O

%hm O
. O

But O
, O
%uh O
, O
we O
want O
to O
write O
a O
letter O
, O
and O
then O
a B-CARDINAL
couple I-CARDINAL
articles O
. O

yeah O
. O

%hm O
. O
impressive O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
much O
you O
know O
about O
scientific O
literature O
, O

but O
letters O
are O
much O
more O
prestigious O
than O
, O
articles O
. O

oh O
, O
okay O
. O

oh O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
. O

okay O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
that O
's O
why O
it O
's O
actually O
a O
big O
deal O
is O

I O
mean O
, O
you O
know O
, O
writing O
a O
couple O
of O
articles O
based O
on O
your O
Master O
's O
thesis O
, O
is O
, O
not O
at O
all O
unusual O
in O
Physics O

and O
yeah O
. O
%uh O
, O
it O
's O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
would O
be O
writing O
a O
letter O
that O
is O
the O
impressive O
part O
of O
it O
all O
. O



And O
what O
's O
actually O
kind O
of O
interesting O
is O
I O
kept O
telling O
Neil B-PERSON
that O
I O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
kind O
of O
significant O
. O

And O
Neil B-PERSON
kept O
writing O
back O
that O
I O
should O
tone O
this O
part O
of O
the O
thesis O
down O
that O
You O
know O
, O
people O
see O
the O
anti O
phased O
motion O
, O

and O
it O
's O
true O

they O
do O
in O
the O
transients O

And O
I O
was O
having O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
getting O
across O
to O
him O
that O
all O
of O
the O
literature O
has O
this O
frequency O
in O
the O
transients O
Yes O
. O
%eh O
and O
not O
driven O
. O

And O
, O
%uh O
, O
what O
happened O
was O
after O
I O
had O
turned O
in O
my O
thesis O
but O
before O
I O
saw O
Neil B-PERSON
again O
, O
he O
went O
to O
a O
conference O
in O
Rochester B-GPE
and O
there O
this O
was O
a O
big O
issue O
among O
the O
people O
who O
were O
doing O
this O
work O
, O
was O
, O
that O
their O
models O
could O
n't O
show O
this O
as O
a O
driven O
frequency O
, O

yet O
their O
experiments O
showed O
it O
as O
a O
driven O
frequency O
. O

oh O
cool O
. O

and O
so O
Neil B-PERSON
then O
-- O
Said O
oh O
just O
a O
second B-TIME
I O
-- O
like O
a B-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE
came O
to O
Bryn B-ORG
Mawr I-ORG

and O
he O
said O
, O
hey O
Lowell B-PERSON
, O
we O
got O
to O
write O
this O
up O
. O

Exactly O
. O

And O
I O
was O
like O
, O
well O
I O
've O
been O
telling O
you O
that O
Neil B-PERSON
. O

Indeed O
. O

So O
Cool O
. O
Cool O
. O
that O
's O
mostly O
the O
sort O
of O
stuff O
that O
I O
'm O
spending O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
on O
now O
. O
%um O

Well O
it O
'll O
look O
good O
on O
your O
C O
V O
, O
your O
resume O
. O

so O
you O
might O
as O
well O
spend O
the O
time O
. O

Yes O
, O
well O
, O

%uh O
, O
no O
, O
it O
's O
definitely O
worth O
doing O
. O
%um O
, O

and O
I O
would O
have O
been O
spending O
more O
time O
on O
it O
if O
it O
were O
n't O
for O
%uh O
dealing O
with O
the O
burglary O
issues O
oh O
yeah O
but O
that O
I O
've O
been O
dealing O
with O
. O

So O
are O
you O
still O
living O
in O
that O
house O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
park O
. O

Yes O
. O

yeah O
, O
okay O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
thing O
that O
i- O

this O
place O
is O
incredibly O
easy O
to O
break O
into O
if O
you O
want O
to O
. O

oh O
. O

It O
's O
not O
a O
question O
of O
whether O
or O
not O
, O
%uh O
you O
know O
, O
that O
was O
easy O
, O

it O
was O
just O
that O
no O
one O
really O
knew O
it O
was O
worth O
breaking O
into O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Exactly O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
so O
the O
problem O
is O
that O
now O
they O
found O
out O
that O
it O
's O
worth O
breaking O
into O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
unfortunately O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
odd O
. O

They O
've O
stolen O
very O
weird O
things O
for O
the O
most O
part O
. O

%hm O
. O

as O
far O

yeah O

as O
a O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
they O
broke O
in O
, O
what O
they O
stole O
was O
just O
bizarre O
, O

mostly O
worthless O
stuff O
. O

And O
, O
%uh O
%huh O
the O
most O
worthwhile O
thing O
as O
far O
as O
monetary O
value O
went O
that O
they O
stole O
was O
the O
pre-amplifier O
of O
my O
stereo O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
because O
it O
's O
a O
nice O
pre-amplifier O
, O

it O
has O
an O
off O
board O
power O
supply O
which O
they O
did O
n't O
steal O
, O
which O
makes O
the O
thing O
that O
they O
**stoled** O
absolutely O
worthless O
. O

%huh O
. O

So O
. O

That O
's O
bizarre O
. O
Bizarre O
. O

so O
when O
they O
broke O
in O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
time O
did O
they O
steal O
the O
%uh O
offboard O
amplifier O
? O

Actually O
, O
no O
, O

all O
they O
stole O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
time O
was O
my O
bike O
. O

%huh O
. O

Which O
was O
actually O
where O
the O
major O
problem O
came O
. O
Exactly O
. O
Exactly O
. O
yeah O
. O
Is O
that O
I O
suddenly O
had O
no O
transportation O
. O

And O
so O
, O
I O
then O
had O
to O
go O
bike O
hunting O
and O
eventually O
get O
another O
bike O
, O

and O
%mm O
. O
that O
cost O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
. O

yeah O
. O

Exactly O
. O

Because O
, O

yes O

Spending O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
hunting O
for O
bikes O
, O
and O
nah O
well O
. O
then O
getting O
one B-CARDINAL
purchased O
, O
and O
then O
having O
to O
, O
you O
know O
, O
go O
get O
it O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

But O
, O
that O
's O
dealt O
with O
at O
least O
. O

And O
so O
%uh O
, O
that O
's O
yeah O
at O
least O
dealt O
with O
. O

Now O
I O
just O
have O
to O
work O
on O
the O
financial O
aspects O
of O
all O
of O
this O
. O

But O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
. O

At O
least O
Well O
that O
would O
make O
sense O
during O
the O
summer O
%uh O
according O
to O
the O
stipulations O
of O
my O
fellowship O
, O
I O
can O
actually O
earn O
money O
during O
the B-DATE
summer I-DATE
. O




But O
%uh O
, O
yeah O
, O

it O
's O
still O
a O
fairly O
expensive O
call O

%uh O
but O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
less O
expensive O
if O
we O
do O
it O
that O
way O
than O
if O
we O
actually O
make O
my O
parents O
in O
law O
pay O
it O
, O

then O
it O

the O
Dutch B-NORP
have O
such O
high O
taxes O
on O
those O

they O
consider O
it O
a O
luxury O
to O
call O
around O
the O
world O

so O
they O
tax O
it O
really O
high O
. O

Anyway O
%um O

So O
you O
guys O
will O
be O
in O
either O
the B-DATE
eighteenth I-DATE
or O
the B-DATE
nineteenth I-DATE

and O
you O
're O
going O
to O
go O
to O
%uh O
Amsterdam B-GPE
. O

Well O
I O
would O
say O
is O
once O
you O
're O
at O
a O
hotel O
uh-huh O
%um O
, O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
call O
me O
at O
work O
and O
let O
me O
know O
where O
you O
are O
, O

and O
then O
we O
can O
make O
arrangements O
that O
day O
%um O
, O
that O
I O
can O
meet O
you O
in O
Amsterdam B-GPE
. O

And O
maybe O
I O
'll O
come O
by O
, O
public O
transport O
. O

It O
's O
probably O
easier O
for O
me O
to O
come O
by O
public O
transport O
in O
Amsterdam B-GPE
than O
it O
is O
for O
me O
to O
come O
by O
car O
to O
be O
honest O
. O

mhm O
. O

The O
streets O
are O
small O

and O
there O
's O
no O
parking O
. O

So O
I O
probably O
will O
come O
by O
public O
transport O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

We O
'll O
see O
where O
you O
're O
staying O

%um O

and O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
more O
for O
you O
guys O
if O
you O
want O
to O
see O
stuff O

you O
can O
see O
stuff O
in O
Amsterdam B-GPE

and O
%uh O
since O
the O
days O
are O
really O
long O
, O

I O
mean O
it O
stays O
light O
here O
till O
about O
ten B-TIME
thirty I-TIME
eleven B-TIME
o'clock I-TIME
mhm O
. O
at B-TIME
night I-TIME
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
we O
can O
take O
a O
ride O
and O
go O
see O
stuff O
at B-TIME
night I-TIME

and O
I O
can O
take O
you O
to O
some O
places O
, O

we O
can O
%uh O
go O
see O
some O
stuff O
. O

%um O
, O
depends O
on O
what O
you O
guys O
want O
to O
see O
. O

So O
you O
guys O
should O
pick O
out O
the O
things O
you O
want O
to O
see O
and O
let O
me O
know O
. O

okay O

%um O
and O
I O
'll O
sit O
and O
talk O
with O
Anya B-PERSON
about O
some O
things O
that O
maybe O
we O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
neat O
for O
you O
to O
see O
. O

So O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
ideas O
we O
'll O
just O
put O
something O
together O
for O
you O
. O

okay O
. O

%um O
but O
yeah O

but O
I O
can O
pick O
you O
up O
th- O
, O

you O
know O
I O
'll O
probably O
be O
there O
some O
time O
around B-TIME
six I-TIME

and O
we O
can O
like O
do O
a O
quick O
dinner O
or O
something O
yeah O
and O
go O
see O
whatever O
you O
want O
to O
see O
, O

if O
you O
want O
to O
stay O
in O
Amsterdam B-GPE
that O
's O
fine O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
go O
%uh O
off O
into O
the O
countryside O
somewhere O
and O
see O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
, O
echte O
Holland B-GPE
, O
real O
Holland B-GPE
and O
we O
can O
do O
that O
too O
. O

Actually O
I O
've O
been O
up O
to O
Holland B-GPE
before O
. O

Spent O
about B-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
up O
there O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
%um O
, O

but O
that O
was O
years B-DATE
and I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago I-DATE
. O

With O
your O
parents O
when O
your O
father O
was O
stationed O
over O
here O
, O
right O
? O

yeah O
. O

But O
we O
got O
to O
see O
Den B-GPE
Haag I-GPE
and O
places O
like O
that O
too O
which O
we O
're O
obviously O
not O
going O
to O
see O
this O
time O
. O

But O
%um O

has O
Kim B-PERSON
been O
here O
before O
? O

And O
, O
an- O

No O
. O

oh O
good O
. O

But O
then O
again O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
that O
Kim B-PERSON
would O
be O
interested O
in O
seeing O
Shape B-FAC
Headquarters I-FAC
and O
you O
know O
all O
that O
kind O
of O
stuff O
. O
those O
military O
things O
. O

Would O
you O
be O
interested O
in O
seeing O
Shape B-FAC
Headquarters I-FAC
again O
. O

No O
. O
Not O
really O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
so O
. O

Somehow O
I O
had O
this O
feeling O
that O
the O
military O
taste O
had O
been O
beaten O
out O
of O
you O
. O

yep O
. O

I O
'm O
, O

the O
mil- O
, O

I O
ca O
n't O
say O
too O
bad O
things O
about O
the O
military O
though O
. O

They O
still O
have O
my O
goods O

and O
they O
'll O
probably O
hold O
them O
hostage O
. O

And O
they O
own O
my O
body O
and O
soul O
for O
like O
another B-DATE
four I-DATE
years I-DATE

so O
I O
just O
got O
to O
pray O
that O
they O

oh O
do O
they O
? O

yeah O
. O

I O
owe O
four B-DATE
years I-DATE
in O
active O
reserve O
time O
. O

aw O
great O
. O

Do O
they O
do O
that O
to O
everyone O
? O

Milo O
, O
get O
out O
of O
there O

yeah O
-- O
-- O
%eh O
everyone O
%uh O
who O
has O
n't O
been O
like O
you O
were O

you O
went O
through O
like O
the O
thirty B-CARDINAL
six I-CARDINAL
two B-CARDINAL
process O
. O

mhm O
. O

So O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
it O

but O
yeah O
if O
you O
just O
separate O
normally O
and O
you O
have O
n't O
served O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
eight I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
then O
you O
owe O
it O
. O

And O
that O
's O
one O
of O
those O
things O
they O
just O
never O
tell O
you O
up O
front O
. O

No O
. O

They O
never O
said O
anything O

I O
figured O
there O
was O
something O
like O
that O
because O

And O
I O
was O
in O
the O
inactive O
reserves O
the O
entire O
time O
I O
was O
in O
college O
too O
. O

So O
. O

yeah O
. O



I O
mean O
that O
's O
the O
military O
. O

I O
have O
my O
discharge O
papers O
and O
everything O

uh-huh O
. O

and O
I O
've O
said O
that O
yeah O
I O
will O
give O
a O
urine O
sample O
or O
a O
blood O
sample O
if O
they O
call O
me O
back O
for O
those O
, O
but O
they O
're O
going O
to O
have O
to O
pay O
my O
trip O
back O
to O
the B-GPE
states I-GPE
. O
because O
there O
's O
no O
bases O
in O
Holland B-GPE
and O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
pay O
out O
of O
my O
own O
expenses O
to O
go O
to O
Germany B-GPE
or O
something O
for O
them O
. O

If O
they O
want O
me O
they O
can O
pay O
, O

bring O
me O
back O
active O
duty O
and O
pay O
me O
for O
the O
day O
if O
they O
're O
going O
to O
drag O
me O
off O
somewhere O
. O

But O
%uh O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
they O
have O
to O
find O
me O
. O

yeah O
, O
that O
's O
the O
other O

it O
was O
i- O
, O

if O
you O
're O
in O
another O
country O
I O
mean O
and O
you O
're O
not O
planning O
on O
coming O
back O
to O
the B-GPE
U I-GPE
S I-GPE
what O
are O
they O
going O
to O
do O
even O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

yeah O
. O

Well O
I O
mean O
I O
'm O
still O
American B-NORP
citizen O

and O
I O
still O
would O
like O
to O
be O
welcome O
in O
my O
own O
country O
. O

Although O
g- O

%uh O
I O
mean O
if O
they O
denied O
my O
citizenship O
and O
I O
became O
a O
citizen O
here O
I O
probably O
would O
n't O
be O
a O
horror O
either O
, O

but O
%uh O
yeah O

right O
now O
I O
mean O
I O
do O
want O
to O
keep O
my O
American B-NORP
citizenship O

so O
. O

I O
kind O
of O
want O
to O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
become O
a O
dual O
citizen O
? O

What O
's O
that O
? O

Are O
you O
going O
to O
try O
and O
become O
a O
dual O
citizen O
? O

Have O
dual O
citizenship O
? O

You O
ca O
n't O
do O
that O
, O

%um O
, O
the O
only O
way O
to O
be O
a O
dual O
citizen O
is O
if O
you O
're O
born O
in O
a O
foreign O
country O

like O
if O
I O
were O
born O
in O
Holland B-GPE
and O
then O
had O
American B-NORP
parents O
. O
Then O
I O
could O
be O
a O
dual O
citizen O
. O

But O
you O
ca O
n't O

If O
I O
would O
to O
ask O
to O
become O
a O
citizen O
in O
Holland B-GPE
I O
would O
automatically O
lose O
my O
American B-NORP
citizenship O
. O

As O
far O
as O
the O
Americans B-NORP
are O
concerned O
, O
yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

The O
Dutch B-NORP
could O
care O
less O
. O

The O
Dutch B-NORP
would O
say O
fine O

want O
to O
be O
a O
dual O
citizen O
, O

that O
's O
fine O
, O

but O
the O
Americans B-NORP
as O
soon O
as O
you O
ask O
for O
another O
citizenship O
that O
act O
of O
asking O
for O
it O
takes O
away O
your O
American B-NORP
citizenship O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
stupid O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
I O
'm O
an O
expatriot O
. O

An O
American B-NORP
expatriot O
. O

An O
American B-NORP
living O
abroad O
. O

I O
still O
have O
to O
file O
a O
tax O
return O
. O

Do O
you O
? O

yeah O
. O

But O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
seventy B-MONEY
five I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
worth O
of O
income O
is O
tax O
free O
. O

Good O
grief O
. O

As O
long O
as O
I O
do O
n't O
bring O
it O
back O
to O
the O
states O
. O

Good O
grief O
. O

I B-ORG
R I-ORG
S I-ORG
for O
you O
, O
%huh O
? O

yeah O
. O

oh O
they O
want O
their O
share O
. O

They O
want O
their O
piece O
of O
meat O
. O

But O
all O
foreign O
taxes O
are O
deductible O
, O

and O
my O
taxes O
here O
are O
fifty B-PERCENT
percent I-PERCENT
of O
income O
. O

So O
the O
taxes O
here O
are O
so O
much O
higher O
that O
, O
yeah O
I O
would O
never O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
it O
. O

Unless O
you O
became O
C O
E O
O O
of O
the O
company O
then O
maybe O
like O
a B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
would O
be O
taxable O
, O
right O
? O

yeah O
. O

Somehow O
it O
raises O
a O
small O
amount O

's O
American B-NORP
salary O
is O

Dutch I-ORG
government I-ORG

and O
the O
amount O
we O
pay O
the B-ORG
American I-ORG
government I-ORG

, O

but O
we O
'll O
still O
owe O
some O
taxes O
. O

Th- O
, O

see O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
it O
works O
. O

we O
're O
going O
to O
be O
in O
need O

I O
have O
no O

that O
all O
works O
. O

They O

the O
Quicken B-PRODUCT
Dutch B-LANGUAGE
version O
? O

yeah O
. O

%ah O
, O
you O
know O
I O
would O
n't O
trust O
it O
because O
it O
's O
so O
complicated O
with O
this O
international O
garbage O
or O
else O
the B-PRODUCT
Turbo I-PRODUCT
Tax I-PRODUCT
with O
the O
Dutch B-LANGUAGE
modules O
. O
that O
I O
just O
would O
n't O
trust O
it O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
%eh O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
complicated O
when O
you O
're O
dealing O
with O
a O
Dutch B-LANGUAGE
tax O
form O
. O

Anya B-PERSON
had O
to O
read O
it O

and O
Anya B-PERSON
and O
her O
father O
did O
n't O
understand O
the O
damn O
thing O
. O

How O
am O
I O
supposed O
to O
understand O
it O
? O

I O
'm O
really O
looking O
forward O
to O
moving O
to O
Oregon B-GPE
and O
dealing O
with O
, O

Oregon B-GPE
you O
pay O
state O
tax O

Washington B-GPE
you O
do O
n't O
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
that O
cause O
%uh O

yeah O

but O
You O
'll O
be O
a O
student O

so O
you O
, O

I O
mean O
you O
're O

what O
is O
your O
income O
? O

oh O
, O
well O

See O
I O
think O
y- O
, O
%um O
, O

it O
'll O
probably O
be O
about B-MONEY
five I-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
the B-DATE
portion I-DATE
of I-DATE
this I-DATE
year I-DATE
that O
I O
'm O
in O
Oregon B-GPE

and O
then O
next B-DATE
year I-DATE
it O
'll O
be O
eleven B-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
. O

yeah O
. O

But O
I O
mean O
you O
're O
below O
the O
poverty O
line O
at O
that O
level O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
I O
mean O
any O
income O
that O
y- O

Well O

But O
then O
I O
've O
already O
made O
say O
like B-CARDINAL
fifteen I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
or O
whatever O
here O
in O
Washington B-GPE

but O

That O
should O
be O
non O
taxable O
out O
of O
state O
income O
. O

It O
should O

but O
you O
know O
it O
's O
not O
going O
to O
be O
a O
fun O
tax O
return O

. O

I O
had O
that O
when O
I O
went O
into O

. O

But O
then O
again O

had O
Kans- O
, O

had O
to O
file O
three B-CARDINAL
taxes O
. O

I O
had O
to O
file O
Georgia B-GPE
, O
Kansas B-GPE
yeah O
and O
then O
my O
federal O

So O
. O

Well O
, O
%um O
actually O
I O
think O
this O
phone O
call O
's O
just O

Now O
that O
I O

in O
my O
80s B-DATE

looking O
back O
I O
think O
I O
can O
say O
I O
've O
done O
alright O
in O
both O
respects O
, O
and O
I O
've O
learnt O

well O
, O
and O
finding O
favor O

depend O

your O

Journalism O
is O
not O
just O
a O
profession O
, O
but O
should O
also O
be O
a O
vocation O
- O
you O
have O
to O
throw O
yourself O
fully O
into O
this O
infinitely O
broad O
field O
of O
endeavor O
. O

Intellectually O
and O
spiritually O
, O
in O
work O
and O
in O
love O
, O
I O
have O
gained O
experience O
and O
fulfilment O
. O

I O
have O
always O
remembered O
the O
encouragement O
which O
Mr. O
Yu B-PERSON
Youren I-PERSON
gave O
me O
as O
a O
young O
reporter O
. O

He O
said O
that O
to O
be O
a O
fearless O
champion O
of O
social O
justice O
, O
as O
is O
expected O
of O
a O
journalist O
, O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
, O
apart O
from O
energy O
and O
vitality O
, O
is O
modesty O
. O

You O
have O
to O
treat O
everybody O
the O
same O
, O
and O
not O
be O
overawed O
by O
the O
great O
and O
powerful O
. O

A O
president O
or O
a O
street O
sweeper O
deserve O
the O
same O
respect O
as O
a O
human O
being O
, O
and O
should O
both O
be O
treated O
the O
same O
way O
. O

Funnily O
enough O
, O
an O
unassuming O
attitude O
is O
also O
advantageous O
in O
relations O
with O
the O
opposite O
sex O
. O

Chinese B-NORP
society O
is O
male O
dominated O
, O
and O
women O
are O
mostly O
regarded O
as O
having O
a O
subsidiary O
role O
. O

In O
this O
kind O
of O
unfair O
situation O
, O
an O
upstanding O
man O
should O
cherish O
and O
respect O
women O
all O
the O
more O
. O

A O
considerate O
attitude O
can O
be O
expressed O
in O
little O
things O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
when O
you O
see O
that O
a O
hair O
has O
fallen O
onto O
a O
female O
friend O
's O
shoulder O
, O
you O
should O
lightly O
pick O
it O
off O
for O
her O
, O
and O
throw O
it O
away O
or O
put O
it O
in O
your O
pocket O
. O

If O
sincere O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
action O
is O
attractive O
in O
a O
man O
. O

If O
a O
woman O
expresses O
her O
liking O
for O
you O
, O
then O
no O
matter O
whether O
she O
is O
pretty O
, O
or O
whether O
you O
find O
her O
attractive O
, O
you O
should O
respond O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
respect O
. O

When O
I O
was O
a O
young O
reporter O
stationed O
in O
Europe B-LOC
, O
there O
was O
a O
British B-NORP
woman O
reporter O
who O
liked O
me O
very O
much O
. O

Once O
I O
was O
driving O
her O
somewhere O
to O
report O
a O
story O
when O
we O
had O
an O
accident O
, O
and O
she O
suffered O
some O
badly O
broken O
bones O
. O

Although O
I O
was O
n't O
attracted O
to O
her O
in O
that O
way O
, O
I O
went O
to O
see O
her O
every O
day O
in O
hospital O
, O
and O
this O
left O
a O
deep O
impression O
on O
her O
of O
how O
considerate O
Chinese B-NORP
men O
can O
be O
. O

Looking O
back O
at O
my O
life O
, O
I O
've O
hardly O
had O
any O
really O
bad O
experiences O
in O
my O
relationships O
with O
women O
, O
and O
this O
is O
because O
just O
as O
in O
my O
professional O
life O
, O
I O
've O
always O
maintained O
a O
self O
- O
critical O
attitude O
towards O
my O
emotions O
, O
and O
always O
tried O
to O
prevent O
myself O
acting O
like O
a O
male O
chauvinist O
. O



Looks O
are O
something O
you O
are O
born O
with O
, O
but O
character O
is O
something O
you O
can O
work O

can O
outweigh O
your O

This O

the O

it O

true O
that O

can O
come O
from O

grooming O
, O

perhaps O
you O
can O
get O
other O
people O

attention O
by O
creating O
your O
own O
special O
look O
. O

But O
do O
n't O
overdo O
it O
. O

It O
is O
appropriate O
dress O

a O
temperament O
developed O

The O
wax O

is O
a O
tropical O
fruit O
originating O
from O
the O
Malay B-NORP

The O
Dutch B-NORP
brought O
it O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
from O
Java B-GPE
, O
in O
the B-DATE
17th I-DATE
century I-DATE
, O
and O
it O
became O
commonly O
grown O
as O
a O
shade O

Old O
folk O
in O
the O
South B-LOC
remember O
when O
wax O
apples O
were O
" O
just O
something O

on O
" O
- O
the O
kind O
of O
fruit O
that O
grew O
freely O
and O
that O
you O
could O
help O
yourself O
to O
. O

But O
wax O
apples O
have O
increased O
in O
value O
during O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
30 I-DATE
years I-DATE
, O
thanks O
to O
advances O
in O
the O
way O
that O
they O
are O
grown O
. O

For O
example O
, O
the O
" O
bag O
- O
wrap O
" O
method O
was O
originally O
a O
way O
of O
protecting O
budding O
fruit O
from O
birds O
, O
but O
once O
it O
was O
introduced O
to O
Linpien B-GPE
, O
in O
around O
1994 B-DATE
, O
farmers O
found O
it O
enabled O
them O
to O
grow O
more O
lustrous O
, O
shiny O
- O
looking O
wax O
apples O
, O
with O
less O
pesticide O
on O
the O
skin O
. O

The O
method O
soon O
caught O
on O
throughout O
the O
district O
. O

Another O
popular O
technique O
involves O
covering O
the O
trees O
with O
black O
mosquito O
nets O
to O
improve O
yields O
. O

This O
reduces O
the O
amount O
of O
sunlight O
reaching O
the O
trees O
, O
causing O
nutrients O
from O
the O
leaves O
and O
branches O
to O
be O
diverted O
into O
producing O
fruit O
. O

The O
net O
- O
covered O
trees O
blossom O
earlier O
and O
produce O
more O
fruit O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
technique O
, O
black O
pearl O
wax O
apples O
are O
now O
available O
throughout O
most B-DATE
of I-DATE

The O
" O
black O

originate O

but O
it O
was O
Linpien B-GPE
wax O

that O
made O
the O
variety O
famous O
and O
prompted O
the O
dramatic O
growth O
of O
its O
market O

the O
changes O
of O

Here O
are O
a O
few O
suggestions O

, O
looks O
at O
the O
question O
from O
the O
angle O
of O
developmental O
psychology O
. O

He O
points O
out O
that O
the O
path O
of O
life O
is O
continuous O
: O
everyone O
moves O
from O
infancy O
and O
childhood O
, O
to O
youth O
and O
middle O
age O
. O

Smoothly O
passing O
through O
any O
period O
of O
life O
helps O
make O
getting O
through O
the O
next O
period O
easier O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
the O
people O
most O
at O
risk O
during O
middle O
age O
are O
those O
who O
have O
had O
difficulties O
earlier O
in O
life O
. O

Foreign O
research O
shows O
that O
those O
with O
high O
social O
and O
economic O
status O
and O
with O
ample O
financial O
resources O
bear O
up O
better O
during O
crisis O
and O
have O
more O
ways O
to O
get O
out O
of O
trouble O
. O

Is O
it O
too O
late O
to O
start O
talking O
about O
these O
problems O
when O
you O
are O
already O
middle O

any O

worthwhile O
, O
no O

when O

Middle O

rather O

they O
're O
not O

Are O
you O

that O
your O

growing O
stale O

Then O
no O
matter O
how O
busy O
you O
are O
, O
you O
've O
got O
to O
set O
aside O
some O
time O
to O
be O
with O
your O
spouse O
. O

Are O
you O
worried O
about O
losing O
your O
job O
? O

Then O
start O
developing O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
skill O
and O
get O
into O
the O
habit O
of O
saving O

to O
care O
for O
your O

them O

encourage O
them O
to O
get O
more O
exercise O

take O
care O
of O

. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
things O
to O
be O
concerned O
about O
during O
middle O
age O
that O
you O
had O
better O
get O
an O
early O
start O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
you O
'll O
end O
up O
being O
overwhelmed O
. O

Start O
over O

In O
China B-GPE
it O
used O
to O
be O
said O
that O
middle O
age O
was O
the O
period O
when O
one O
was O
" O
heir O
to O
the O
ancient O
sages O
and O
the O
teacher O
of O
posterity O
. O
" O

But O
now O
times O
are O
changing O
so O
fast O
that O
perhaps O
the O
lessons O
of O
past O
experience O
are O
no O
longer O
suitable O
for O
solving O
today O
's O
problems O
. O

To O
assume O
a O
posture O
of O
superiority O
based O
on O
one O
's O
seniority O
will O
make O
one O
despised O
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
cast O
aside O
one O
's O
old O
self O
and O
start O
over O
. O

Chiu B-PERSON
notes O
that O
many O
middle O
- O
aged O
who O
have O
worked O
diligently O
for O
years O
to O
attain O
management O
positions O
look O
down O
on O
the O
younger O
generation O
for O
being O
reckless O
and O
disorganized O
, O
but O
they O
do O
n't O
realize O
that O
creativity O
and O
energy O
may O
be O
ready O
to O
explode O
from O
underneath O
these O
flaws O
. O

Stuck O
in O
the O
past O
and O
full O
of O
bitterness O
, O
they O
may O
end O
up O
getting O
discarded O
onto O
the O
scrap O
heap O
of O
history O
. O

With O
each O
new O
era O
, O
role O
models O
change O
. O

Until O
the O
new O
role O
models O
have O
been O
established O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
maintain O
flexibility O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
today O
's O
middle O
- O
aged O
Chinese B-NORP
women O
are O
the O
first O
to O
have O
obtained O
advanced O
degrees O
and O
to O
have O
come O
in O
contact O
with O
the O
women O
's O
liberation O
movement O
. O

They O
set O
high O
expectations O
for O
themselves O
, O
but O
their O
disappointments O
are O
likewise O
large O
. O

Many O
women O
are O
torn O
between O
conflicting O
desires O
: O
to O
be O
good O
homemakers O
like O
their O
mothers O
and O
to O
have O
successful O
careers O
like O
their O
fathers O
. O

Their O
candles O
are O
burning O
at O
both O
ends O
, O
because O
they O
are O
trying O
to O
live O
up O
to O
two B-CARDINAL
old O
role O
models O
rather O
than O
establishing O
a O
new O
one O
for O
themselves O
. O

Then O
there O
are O
men O
who O
insist O
upon O
being O
strict O
fathers O
and O
disciplinarians O
or O
staying O
at O
the O
same O
company O
until O
they O
retire O
. O

And O
there O
are O
women O
who O
are O
determined O
to O
play O
the O
role O
of O
the O
traditional O
Chinese B-NORP
wife O
and O
mother O
. O

Ignoring O
the O
changing O
times O
, O
they O
place O
tremendous O
pressure O
on O
themselves O
. O

Turn O
the O
focus O
from O

Life O
is O
a O
process O
that O
moves O

getting O
to O
the O
heart O
of O
the O

. O

Lu B-PERSON
explains O
that O
as O
children O
people O
yearn O
for O
the O
affection O
of O
their O
parents O
; O
as O
adolescents O
they O
want O
the O
affirmation O
of O
their O
peers O
; O
and O
as O
adults O
, O
they O
set O
their O
sights O
on O
educational O
qualifications O
, O
finding O
a O
good O
job O
, O
making O
money O
, O
marrying O
a O
good O
spouse O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

Everyone O
puts O
the O
emphasis O
on O
outward O
manifestations O
of O
success O
, O
and O
this O
emphasis O
on O
the O
glitter O
of O
outward O
achievement O
continues O
up O
to O
middle O
age O
. O

" O
By O
middle O
age O
, O
people O
have O
gotten O
from O
the O
outside O

just O
about O
all O
they O
can O
, O
" O
says O
Lu B-PERSON

" O
What O

have O
n't O
attained O
yet O
they O
probably O
wo O
n't O

, O
so O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
getting O
all O
worked O
up O
about O
it O
. O

This O
is O
the O
time O
of O

when O
the O
doubts O
set O

" O

Many O

When O
the O
doubts O
come O
, O
some O
people O
continue O
trying O
to O
find O
answers O
from O
outside O

thinking O
that O
everything O
would O
be O
fine O
if O
they O
could O
just O
change O
jobs O
or O
wives O

But O
then O
they O
rashly O
switch O
jobs O
or O
foolishly O
get O
involved O
in O
an O
affair O
only O
to O
find O
that O

just O
made O

worse O

" O
In O

prepare O

all O

at O

Middle O

people O
have O
heavy O
burdens O
, O
and O
sometimes O
they O
may O
feel O
as O
if O
they O
are O
suffocating O
under O
them O
. O

" O
But O
accomplishing O
a O
lot O
of O
little O
changes O
can O
bring O
about O
a O
big O
change O
. O
" O

If O
you O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
do O
what O
you O
can O
, O
you O
will O
immediately O
find O
that O
your O

the O

In O
particular O
, O
biochips O
not O
only O
can O
speed O
the O
pace O
of O
research O

but O
can O
also O
replace O
laboratory O

in O
many O

with O
tests O
being O
carried O
out O
directly O
on O
human O

on O
the O

Thus O
as O
research O
tools O
biochips O
are O
not O
only O
convenient O

quick O

also O

" O
the O
poor O
man O

" O
since O
they O
cost O
a B-CARDINAL

. O

Apart O
from O
the O
material O
itself O
being O
cheaper O
, O
the O
nylon O
chips O
use O
a O
visible O

system O
to O
display O
results O

so O
that O
they O
can O
be O

which O
costs O

BMEC B-ORG

observes O
that O
the O
level O

technical O
know O
- O
how O
required O
for O
biochip O
production O
is O
very O
high O
, O
so O
that O
the O
opportunities O
for O
contract O
manufacture O
are O
limited O
. O

However O
, O
due O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
early O
entry O
into O
biochip O
research O
and O
development O
, O
and O
the O
high O
state O
of O
development O
of O
its O
semiconductor O
industry O
, O
the O
island O
is O
well O
supplied O
with O
relevant O
technology O
and O
skills O
. O

Thus O
, O
says O
Lee B-PERSON
, O
" O
Taiwan B-GPE
should O
have O
opportunities O
to O
enter O
this O
field O
not O
merely O
as O
a O
contract O
manufacturer O
. O
" O

The O
potential O
and O
importance O
of O
biochips O
is O
plain O
to O
see O
, O
but O
in O
this O
new O
, O
interdisciplinary O
industry O
, O
there O
are O
still O
many O
obstacles O
and O
difficulties O
to O
overcome O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
technology O
is O
not O
yet O
mature O
, O
and O
that O
generally O
accepted O
, O
mutually O
compatible O
international O
standards O
have O
not O
yet O
emerged O
, O
the O
biggest O
bottleneck O
for O
biochips O
at O
the O
moment O
is O
the O
many O
thousands O
of O
patents O
which O
have O
been O
taken O
out O
in O
the O
field O
, O
which O
limit O
the O
avenues O
available O
to O
each O
player O
. O

" O
Because O
this O
area O
is O
a O
patents O
minefield O
, O
it O
's O
impossible O
to O
create O
a O
product O
which O
from O
start O

does O
n't O
infringe O

anyone O
else O

" O
says O
Johnsee B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON
. O

In O
his O
view O
, O
this O
problem O
may O
be O
resolved O
in O
the O
future O
by O
the O
exchange O
of O
patented O
technologies O
between O
players O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
at O
this O
stage O
companies O
must O
actively O
carry O
out O
research O
and O
development O
, O
and O
obtain O
international O
patents O
, O
in O

bargaining O

At O
present O

the O
BMEC B-ORG

over O
10 B-CARDINAL

Although O

already O
a O
great O

our O
goal O

" O
says O
Johnsee B-PERSON
Lee I-PERSON

He O
says O
that O
only O
if O

results O

does O

produce O
an O
economic O
payback O

Equally O
, O
to O
have O
a O
really O
broad O
market O

to O
go O
beyond O

Lee B-PERSON
points O
out O
that O

sample O

the O

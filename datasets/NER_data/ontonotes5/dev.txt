void O

severable O

The O
1990 B-DATE

attempts O

strip O

empowers O

approval O
: O

Yet O
Section B-LAW
605 I-LAW
of O
the O

Thus O
, O
with O
one O
brief O
passage O
in O
an O
appropriations O
bill O
, O
Congress B-ORG
repeals O
the O
president O

power O
to O
make O
recess O
appointments O
under O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
. O

Section B-LAW
605 I-LAW
also O
imposes O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
on O
the O
president O
's O
ability O
to O
nominate O
candidates O
of O
his O
choosing O
. O

The O
language O
of O
the O
appropriations O
rider O
implies O
that O
any O
nomination O
to O
any O
position O
of O
a O
rejected O
nominee O
will O
result O
in O
the O
president O
being O
denied O
funding O
to O
pay O
that O
person O
's O
salary O
. O

The O
president O
could O
probably O
not O
avoid O
this O
restriction O
by O
choosing O
people O
willing O
to O
serve O
without O
pay O
, O
because O
the B-LAW
Anti-Deficiency I-LAW
Act I-LAW
prohibits O
voluntary O
service O
to O
the O
government O
. O

The O
1990 B-DATE
appropriations O
bills O
also O
contain O
a O
number O
of O
`` O
muzzling O
'' O
provisions O
that O
violate O
the O
recommendation O
clause O
in O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW

Muzzling O
provisions O
, O
which O
might O
be O
called O
`` O
blindfold O
laws O
'' O
as O
well O
, O
prevent O
the O
executive O
branch O
from O
even O
looking O
at O
certain O
policy O
options O
, O
let O
alone O
from O
recommending O
them O
to O
Congress B-ORG
. O

Such O
laws O
violate O
the O
provision O
in O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
that O
requires O
the O
president O
to O
make O
recommendations O
to O
Congress B-ORG
, O
but O
which O
gives O
the O
president O
the O
discretion O
to O
select O
the O
subject O
matter O
of O
those O
recommendations O
. O

Typically O
, O
these O
laws O
seek O
to O
prevent O
executive O
branch O
officials O
from O
inquiring O
into O
whether O
certain O
federal O
programs O

any O
economic O
sense O
or O
proposing O
more O
market O

oriented O
alternatives O
to O
regulations O

Probably O
the O
most O
egregious O
example O
is O
a O
proviso O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
that O
prevents O
the O

There O
is O
something O
inherently O
suspect O
about O
Congress B-ORG

prohibiting O
the O
executive O
from O
even O
studying O
whether O
public O

being O
wasted O
in O
some O
favored O
program O

other O
. O

none O
of O
the O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
contained O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bills O
for O

Even O
more O

The O

, O
the O

not O

Also O
, O

are O
in O
better O

They O
are O
better O

They O
are O
in O
less O

nothing O

on O

The O

That O

A O

could O
give O
them O
their O

A O

Mr. O

took O
notice O
in O

when O
Sony B-ORG

changed O
the O

on O
the O
famous O
Walkman B-PRODUCT
line O
of O

created O
the O
My B-PRODUCT
First I-PRODUCT
Sony I-PRODUCT
line O
for O
children O
. O

The O
brightly O
colored O

looked O
more O
like O

than O
the O

-LRB- O
In O
court O
papers O
, O
Sony B-ORG
says O
it O
has O
spent O
more B-MONEY

$ I-MONEY
3 I-MONEY
million I-MONEY
to O
promote O
the O

over B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL

Sony B-ORG
found O
a O
new O
market O
niche O
, O
but O
Mr. O

figured O
that O
its O
prices O
left O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
a O
lower O

competitor O

His O
products O
are O
n't O
exact O
copies O
of O
Sony B-ORG

strongly O
resemble O
them O
in O

, O
especially O
, O
color O

so O
does O

on O

Two B-CARDINAL

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O

produced O
only O
circumstantial O

`` O

that O

On O
another O

Despite O
convincing O
arguments O
, O
it O
was O
never O
established O
that O
Mr. O

personally O
ordered O

the O

The O
central O
weakness O
of O

was O
pointed O
up O

when O

The O

tried O
to O

Naturally O

neither O

So O
it O
seems O
that O
Mr. O

may O
have O
unwittingly O
served O

PASOK B-ORG

whether O

not O

can O
now O
traipse O

wo O
n't O
help O
PASOK B-ORG
regain O
power O
, O
Mr. O
Papandreou B-PERSON
should O
never O
be O
underestimated O
. O

First B-ORDINAL
came O
his O
predictable O
fusillade O
: O
He O
charged O
the O
Coalition B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Left I-ORG
and O
Progress B-ORG
had O
sold O
out O
its O
leftist O
tenets O
by O
collaborating O
in O
a O
right O
- O
wing O
plot O
aimed O
at O
ousting O
PASOK B-ORG
and O
thwarting O
the O
course O
of O
socialism O
in O
Greece B-GPE
. O

Then O
, O
to O
buttress O
his O
credibility O
with O
the O
left O
, O
he O
enticed O
some O
smaller O
leftist O
parties O
to O
stand O
for O
election O
under O
the O
PASOK B-ORG
banner O
. O

Next O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
court O
the O
communists O
-- O
many O
of O
whom O
feel O
betrayed O
by O
the O
left O
- O
right O
coalition O
's O
birth O
-- O
by O
bringing O
into O
PASOK B-ORG
a O
well O
- O
respected O
Communist B-ORG
Party I-ORG
candidate O
. O

For O
balance O
, O
and O
in O
hopes O
of O
gaining O
some O
disaffected O
centrist O
votes O
, O
he O
managed O
to O
attract O
a O
former O
New B-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
Party I-ORG
representative O
and O
known O
political O
enemy O
of O
Mr. O
Mitsotakis B-PERSON
. O

Thus O
PASOK B-ORG
heads O
for O
the O
polls O
not O
only O
with O
diminished O
scandal O
- O
stench O
, O
but O
also O
with O

the O
matter O

That O

those O

a O

But O
what O
about O
those O
of O
us O
whose O
views O
are O
not O
predetermined O
by O
formula O
or O

? O

How O
should O
we O
think O
about O

? O

Let O
's O
begin O
by O
recognizing O
a O
main O
source O
of O
confusion O
-- O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
has O
no O
agreed O
meaning O
. O

Would O
service O
be O
voluntary O
or O
compulsory O
? O

Short O
or O
long O
? O

Part O
- O
time O
or O
full O
- O
time O
? O

Paid O
or O
unpaid O
? O

Would O
participants O
live O
at O
home O
and O
work O
nearby O
or O
live O
in O
barracks O
and O
work O
on O
public O
lands O
? O

What O
kinds O
of O
work O
would O
they O
do O
? O

What O
does O
`` O
national O
'' O
mean O
? O

Would O
the O
program O
be O
run O
by O
the O
federal O
government O
, O
by O
local O
governments O
, O
or O
by O
private O
voluntary O
organizations O
? O

And O
who O
would O
serve O
? O

Only O
males O
, O
as O
with O
the O
draft O
, O
or O
both O

Youth O

all O

Middle O

poor O
people O
, O
or O
a O
genuine O
cross-section O
? O

Many O
or O
few O
? O

Those O
are O
not O
trivial O
questions O
, O
and O
the O
label O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
answers O
none O
of O
them O
. O

Then O
how O
should O
we O
think O
about O
national O
service O
? O

As O
a O
starting O
point O
, O
here O
are O
five B-CARDINAL
propositions O
: O
1 B-CARDINAL
. O
Consider O
the O
ingredients O
, O
not O
the O
name O
. O

Ignore O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
in O
the O
abstract O
; O
consider O
specific O
proposals O
. O

They O
will O
differ O
in O
crucial O
ways O
. O

2 B-CARDINAL
. O
`` O
Service O
'' O
should O
be O
service O
. O

As O
commonly O
understood O
, O
service O
implies O
sacrifice O
. O

It O
involves O
accepting O
risk O
, O
or O
giving O
up O
income O
, O
or O
deferring O
a O
career O
. O

It O
follows O
that O
proposals O
like O
Nunn B-PERSON
- O
McCurdy O
, O
whose O
benefits O
to O
enrollees O
are O
worth O
some O
$ O
17,500 B-MONEY
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
do O
not O
qualify O
. O

There O
is O
a O
rationale O
for O
such O
bills O
: O
Federal O
subsidies O
to O
college O
students O
amount O
to O
`` O
a B-LAW
GI I-LAW
Bill I-LAW
without O
the O
GI O
'' O
; O
arguably O
those O
benefits O
should O
be O
earned O
, O
not O
given O
. O

But O
the O
earnings O
exceed O
by O
20 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
the O
average O
income O
of O
young O
high O
- O
school O
graduates O
with O
full O

time O
jobs O
. O

Why O
call O
that O
service O
? O

3 B-CARDINAL
. O
Encouragement O
is O
fine O
; O
compulsion O
is O
not O
. O

Compelled O
service O
is O
unconstitutional O
. O

It O
is O
also O
unwise O
and O
unenforceable O
. O

-LRB- O
Who O
will O
throw O
several B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand I-CARDINAL
refusers O
in O
jail O
each O
year O
? O
-RRB- O

But O
through O
tax O
policy O
and O
in O
other O
ways O
the O
federal O
government O
encourages O
many O
kinds O
of O
behavior O
. O

It O
should O
also O
encourage O
service O
-- O
preferably O
by O
all O
classes O
and O
all O
ages O
. O

Its O
encouragement O
should O
strengthen O
and O
not O
undercut O
the O
strong O
tradition O
of O
volunteering O
in O
the O
U.S. B-GPE
, O
should O
build O
on O
the O
service O

already O
in O
existence O
, O
and O
should O
honor O
local O
convictions O
about O
which O
tasks O
most O
need O
doing O
. O

4 B-CARDINAL
. O
Good O
programs O
are O
not O
cheap O
. O

Enthusiasts O
assume O
that O
national O
service O
would O
get O
important O
work O
done O
cheaply O
: O
forest O
fires O
fought O
, O

rehabilitated O
, O
students O
tutored O
, O

There O
is O
important O
work O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
existing O
service O
and O
conservation O
corps O
have O
shown O
that O
even O
youths O
who O
start O
with O
few O
skills O
can O
do O
much O
of O
it O
well O
-- O
but O
not O
cheaply O
. O

Good O
service O
programs O
require O
recruitment O
, O
screening O
, O
training O
and O
supervision O
-- O
all O
of O
high O
quality O
. O

They O
involve O
stipends O
to O
participants O
. O

Full O
- O
time O
residential O
programs O
also O
require O
housing O
and O
full O
- O
time O
supervision O
; O
they O
are O
particularly O
expensive O
-- O
more O
per O
participant O
than O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE
at O
Stanford B-ORG
or O
Yale B-ORG
. O

Non-residential O
programs O
are O
cheaper O
, O
but O
good O
ones O
still O
come O
to O
some O
$ O
10,000 B-MONEY
a O
year O
. O

Are O
they O
worth O
that O
? O

Evaluations O
suggest O
that O
good O
ones O
are O
-- O
especially O
so O
if O
the O
effects O
on O

are O
counted O
. O

But O
the O
calculations O
are O
challengeable O

5 B-CARDINAL

Underclass O
youth O
are O
a O
special O
concern O
. O

Are O
such O

worthwhile O
, O
then O
? O

Yes O
, O
if O
targeted O
. O

People O
of O
all O
ages O
and O
all O
classes O
should O
be O
encouraged O
to O
serve O

but O
there O
are O
many O
ways O
for O
middle O

kids O
, O
and O
their O
elders O
, O
to O
serve O
at O
little O

They O

those O

They O
are O
not O

They O
are O
unlikely O
to O

And O
they O
have O
grown O
up O
in O
unprecedentedly O
grim O

be O
quite O
profoundly O

Some O

accept O
the O
discipline O

others O
drop O
out O

some O

after O
he O
confirmed O

He O
confirmed O
it O

repeating O
verses O

noble O
Koran B-WORK_OF_ART

the O
two B-CARDINAL

both O

enormous O

Arabs B-NORP

all O

Saddam B-PERSON
Hussein I-PERSON
was O
the O
only O
leader O
in O
the O
modern O
history O
of O
this O
nation O
who O
went O
to O
the O
guillotine O
because O
he O
was O
a O
patriot O
who O
refused O
occupation O
and O
surrender O
to O
the O
invasion O
, O
and O
chose O
resistance O
. O

The O
only O
ones O
who O
preceded O
him O
in O
this O
honor O
were O
men O
like O
Umar B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Mukhtar I-PERSON
and O
Yusuf B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Azma I-PERSON
, O
by O
whose O
struggle O
the O
nation O

its O
history O
were O
honored O
, O
and O
kept O
it O
for O
them O
in O
the O
records O
of O
pride O
and O
dignity O
. O

They O
hastily O
executed O
him O
because O
they O
feared O
him O
even O
when O
he O
was O
behind O
bars O
, O
just O
as O
they O
will O
still O
fear O
him O
as O
a O
corpse O
hidden O
under O
the O
soil O
of O
the O
homeland O
, O
and O
comparisons O
between O
his O
time O
and O
their O
bloody O
and O
chaotic O
time O
always O
came O
in O
his O
favor O
, O
and O
the O
calls O
for O
his O
return O
to O
save O
Iraq B-GPE
from O
its O
crisis O
and O
the O
corrupt O
and O
malicious O
gang O
that O
governs O
it O
have O
become O
deafening O
to O
the O
ears O
of O
the O
occupation O
and O
its O
accomplices O
. O

He O
embarrassed O
them O
and O
dwarfed O
them O
by O
standing O
as O
a O
spear O
in O
the O
prisoner O
's O
dock O
. O

They O
were O
terrified O
by O
the O
penetrating O
looks O
of O
his O
eyes O
. O

They O
were O
exposed O
by O
his O
patriotism O
and O
Arabism B-NORP
and O
his O
contempt O
for O
the O
odious O
sectarian O
divisions O
that O
they O
planted O
in O
their O
contaminated O
new O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

So O
they O
decided O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him O
with O
a O
confused O
and O
embarrassing O
hastiness O
. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
technology O
of O
the O

which O
enabled O
us O
to O
recognize O
the O
ugly O

of O
the O
hateful O
sectarianism O
that O
is O
governing O
in O
America B-GPE

Iraq B-GPE

This O

exposed O
the O

, O
and O
blew O
up O
all O

by O
the O
experts O
of O
the O
American B-NORP

the O
naked O
truth O

without O
that O

the O
intention O

He O
was O
right O
when O
he O
turned O
to O
them O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Are O
these O
your O
men O

" O
when O

repeating O

and O
when O
the O
ignorant O
address O
them O
they O
say O
' O
peace O

" O

Is O
it O
manliness O
to O
shout O
hateful O
sectarian O
slogans O
in O

of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
never O
been O

the O
rope O
of O
the O
gallows O
is O
being O
wound O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
his O
soul O
will O
go O
to O
its O
Creator O
in O
a O
few O
seconds O
? O

Are O
these O
the O
tolerant O
ethics O
of O
Islam B-ORG
? O

Are O
these O
the O
values O
of O
Arabism B-NORP
, O
decency O
, O
and O
pride O
? O

Are O
those O
the O
sons O
of O
the O
great O
Iraq B-GPE
which O
had O
always O
stood O
up O
against O
invaders O
throughout O
history O
and O
was O
a O
pillar O
of O
support O
for O
its O
nation O
and O
the O
causes O
of O
justice O
in O
the O
world O
as O
a O
whole O
? O

We O
are O
sorry O
, O
but O
not O
surprised O
, O
because O
some O
Arab B-NORP
governments O
objected O
only O
because O
the O
execution O
took O
place O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
feast I-DATE
of I-DATE
Bairam I-DATE
, O
as O
if O
the O
execution O
of O
this O
man O
would O
have O
been O
permissible O
and O
blessed O
on O
any B-DATE
other I-DATE
day I-DATE
. O

We O
are O
sorry O
again O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Arab B-NORP
leaders O
hid O
in O
their O
palaces O
and O
none O
of O
them O
dared O
to O
speak O
even O
one B-CARDINAL
word O
of O
protest O
out O
of O
fear O
of O
America B-GPE
. O

We O
were O
stabbed O
twice O
, O
first B-ORDINAL
when O
we O
watched O
an O
Arab B-NORP
leader O
being O
led O
to O
the O
gallows O
in O
accordance O
with O
sectarian O
justice O
which O
is O
spiteful O
and O
vengeful O
. O
And O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
time O
when O
we O
did O
not O
see O
anyone O
among O
the O
club O
of O
leaders O
to O
which O
he O
belonged O
for O
more O
than O
30 B-CARDINAL
years O
object O
to O
his O
execution O
. O

Maybe O
God O
wanted O
a O
good O
end O
for O
him O
, O
and O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
when O
He O
induced O
one B-CARDINAL
of O
them O
to O
record O
what O
America B-GPE
and O
the O
government O
of O
sects O
wanted O
to O
hide O
, O
by O
means O
of O
the O
video O
of O
the O
last B-ORDINAL
moments O
, O
which O
created O
a O
historic O
turning O
point O
that O
will O
perhaps O
shape O
the O
history O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
events O
in O
it O
for O
decades B-DATE
to I-DATE
come I-DATE
. O

Maybe O
God O
wanted O
to O
expose O
the O
series O
of O
lies O
of O
Muwaffaq B-PERSON
al I-PERSON

Where O
is O
that O
security O
? O
-RRB- O
, O
who O
went O
out O
to O
the O
world O
saying O
that O
he O
, O
meaning O
President O

was O
weak O

collapsing O
while O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O

meet O
his O
God O

Then O
the O
tape O
comes O
along O
and O
shows O
us O
with O
sound O
and O
image O
that O
we O
are O
in O
front O
of O
a O
courageous O
lion O
, O
who O
refuses O

wear O
the O

just O
as O
he O
refused O
to O
take O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
they O
offered O
him O
. O



Why O
the O
mask O
, O
and O
why O
the O
pills O
? O

The O
mask O
is O
for O
traitors O
and O
criminals O
who O
are O
ashamed O
of O
their O
treason O
or O
their O
crimes O
, O
and O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
are O
appropriate O
for O
those O
who O
can O
not O
face O
history O
because O
of O
their O
bad O
deeds O
. O

The O
American B-NORP
administration O
committed O
a O
fatal O
mistake O
and O
revealed O
a O
major O
foolishness O
to O
be O
added O
to O
its O
many O
foolishnesses O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
when O
it O
executed O
this O
man O
, O
in O
a O
way O
for O
which O
it O
will O
pay O
a O
hefty O
price O
in O
the B-DATE
near I-DATE
future I-DATE
. O

His O
survival O
would O
have O
benefited O
it O
much O
more O
than O
his O
execution O
if O
they O
understood O
politics O
as O
they O
should O
, O
because O
his O
survival O
could O
have O
been O
a O
card O
to O
threaten O
the O
sectarians O
and O
keep O
them O
as O
servants O
to O
them O
and O
their O
schemes O
, O
just O
as O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
bargaining O
chip O
for O
calming O
down O
the O
resistance O
and O
the O
broad O
Iraqi B-NORP
sector O
which O
supports O
it O
. O

But O
they O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
except O
grudges O
, O
and O
they O
do O
not O
want O
anything O
other O
than O
inflicting O
more O
degradation O
on O
the O
Arabs B-NORP
and O
Muslims B-NORP
by O
his O
execution O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
American B-NORP
administration O
will O
have O
succeeded O
in O
one B-CARDINAL
thing O
only O
, O
intentionally O
and O
with O
planning O
or O
without O
it O
, O
namely O
, O
deepening O
the O

not O
only O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
but O
in O
the O
Islamic B-NORP
world O
as O

strong O
blow O
to O
all O
the O

half B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
after O
I O
graduated O
and O
found O
a O
job O
. O

The O
revolution O
could O
be O
said O
a O
rudimentary O
one O
, O
which O
made O
me O
decide O
eventually O
to O
eliminate O
all O
the O
betrayers O
and O
heretics O
in O
one O
action O
!. O

The O
incident O
was O
caused O
by O
a O
molar O
. O

The O
location O
of O
the O
tooth O
was O
just O
next O
to O
the O
broken O
wisdom O
tooth O
that O
led O
to O
my O
first B-ORDINAL
visit O
to O
an O
American B-NORP
dentist O
. O

For O
some O
unknown O
reason O
, O
when O
I O
was O
eating O
the O
other O
day O
, O
the O
tooth O
suddenly O
ached O
during O
the O
meal O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
painful O
. O

Unexpected O
I O
heard O
a O
" O
crack O
" O
while O
I O
was O
eating O
, O
and O
part O
of O
the O
tooth O
fell O
off O
!. O

I O
could O
not O
remember O
eating O
anything O
hard O
?!. O

I O
rushed O
to O
the O
dentist O
, O
who O
said O
root O
canal O
therapy O
upon O
seeing O
it O
, O
your O
dental O
nerve O
had O
come O
out O
!. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
root O
canal O
meant O
but O
thought O
the O
name O
was O
quite O
fancy O
. O

It O
was O
after O
I O
began O
to O
receive O
it O
that O
I O
found O
it O
really O
painful O
!. O

For O
example O
killing O
the O
nerves O
, O
and O
dealing O
with O
the O
dental O
crown O
... O

I O
asked O
the O
dentist O
then O
why O
my O
tooth O
broke O
. O

After O
examining O
my O
25 B-CARDINAL
teeth O
, O
the O
dentist O
told O
me O
seriously O
that O
the O
teeth O
on O
the O
right O
side O
were O
somewhat O
" O
cross O
biting O
" O
due O
to O
the O
" O
parallel O
shift O
" O
of O
my O
teeth O
, O
such O
that O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
right O
teeth O
were O
always O
against O
each O
other O
. O

The O
wrong O
position O
had O
led O
to O
uneven O
abrasions O
, O
resulting O
in O
the O
broken O
tooth O
. O

I O
asked O
what O
solutions O
are O
available O
? O

The O
dentist O
said O
" O
correction O

" O

Thus O
, O
three B-DATE

after O
I O
ran O

The O
accident O
was O
a O
car O

. O

Much O
of O
the O

denounced O
that O

's O
front O
airbag O
failed O
to O
release O
, O
which O
caused O
the O
death O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the B-PRODUCT
MINI I-PRODUCT
COOPER I-PRODUCT
she O
was O
riding O
in O
is O
not O
what O
the O
reports O
said O
. O

It O
is O
the O
car O
with O
the O
highest O
safety O
index O
. O

It O
is O
sold O
for O
190,000 B-MONEY
HK I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
in O
Hong B-GPE
Kong I-GPE
. O

Polo B-PRODUCT
also O
sells O
for O
more O
than O
140,000 B-MONEY
HK I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
cute O
little O
car O
, O
preferred O
by O
girls O
. O

But O
safety O
is O
surely O
not O
too O
big O
of O
a O
problem O
. O

The O
collision O
happened O
on O
the O
side O
and O
rear O
. O

So O
, O
the O
side O
airbag O
and O
air O
curtain O
were O
fully O
opened O
. O

They O
opened O
at O
the O
time O
of O
first B-ORDINAL
collision O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
. O

The O
first B-ORDINAL
collision O
was O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
only O
, O
and O
the O
impact O
on O
the O
people O
was O
very O
small O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
was O
the O
protection O
of O
the O
air O
curtain O
. O

So O
, O
there O
would O
surely O
not O
be O
a O
big O
problem O
. O

The O
real O
fatal O
collision O
was O
the O
second B-ORDINAL
one O
from O
the O
tailgating O
truck O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
all O
the O
airbags O
were O
already O
deflated O
. O

There O
was O
no O
protective O
effect O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
force O
of O
this O
one O
was O
extremely O
large O
. O

If O
the O
car O
had O
been O
stopped O
at O
an O
angle O
, O
then O
the O
head O
of O
the O
person O
sitting O
on O
one O
side O
would O
surely O
have O
hit O
the O
glass O
or O
the O
B O
column O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
there O
would O
not O
have O
been O
too O
much O
of O
a O
problem O
for O
someone O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

This O
is O
common O
knowledge O
. O

Then O
it O
came O
down O
to O
who O
had O
the O
bad O
luck O
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
car O
that O
was O
angled O
out O
. O

It O
was O
perfectly O
correct O
for O
the O
front O
airbag O
not O
to O
open O
, O
because O
the O
front O
of O
the O
car O
was O
not O
damaged O
at O
all O
. O

None O
of O
the O
sensors O
received O
any O
signal O
of O
a O
collision O
. O

Just O
imagine O
, O
this O
was O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

The O
people O
went O
backward O
abruptly O
. O

Their O
bodies O
could O
have O
been O
supported O
by O
the O
seats O
, O
but O
the O
impact O
on O
their O
necks O
and O
heads O
was O
tremendous O
. O

When O
they O
went O
abruptly O
backward O
, O
any O
additional O
misfortune O
of O
the O
front O
airbag O
opening O
for O
no O
reason O
would O
have O
eliminated O
any O
chance O
of O
survival O
. O

So O
, O
of O
all O
the O
cars O
in O
the O
world O
, O
even O
a O
Rolls B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
Royce I-PRODUCT
, O
the O
front O
airbag O
will O
not O
open O
during O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

If O
the O
front O
airbag O
opened O
after O
being O
tailgated O
, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
quality O
problem O
, O
and O
would O
be O
extremely O
dangerous O
. O

The O
safety O
airbag O
's O
eruption O
could O
knock O
someone O
to O
death O
. O

So O
, O
infants O
are O
strictly O
forbidden O
from O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
seat O
. O

That O
was O
how O
the O
whole O
accident O
took O
place O
. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
accident O
investigation O
division O
will O
not O
be O
different O
from O
this O
. O

For O
this O
kind O
of O
accident O
, O
conclusions O
can O
be O
drawn O
from O
a O
single O
glance O
at O
the O
car O
wreckage O
. O

The O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
have O
no O
fault O
. O

All O
of O
the O
car O
's O
passive O
safety O
protections O
had O
already O
fully O
carried O
out O
their O
functions O
. O

So O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
ridiculous O
and O
unscientific O
to O
blame O
and O
suspect O
the O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
for O
such O
an O
accident O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
speculation O
about O
why O
the O
front O
airbags O
did O
not O
open O
was O
very O
amateurish O
. O

Only O
by O
not O
opening O
would O
it O
have O
been O
correct O
. O

If O
they O
had O
opened O
, O
her O
assistant O
might O
still O
be O
lying O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O

If O
an O
accident O
occurs O
on O
the O
freeway O
, O
please O
get O
out O
of O
the O
car O
and O
leave O
immediately O
if O
you O
can O
move O
. O

Many O
freeway O
accidents O
occur O
simply O
because O
people O
stay O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
sort O
out O
their O
thoughts O
, O
following O
which O
there O
is O
a O
fatal O
crash O
from O
a O
car O
following O
behind O
. O

About O
death O
, O
I O
have O
always O
believed O
that O
they O
do O
not O
leave O
the O
world O
. O

They O
only O
leave O
the O
human O
world O
. O

They O
are O
surely O
sharing O
the O
same O
world O
with O
us O
, O
with O
a O
different O
manifestation O
of O
life O
. O

an O
ordinary O
person O
, O
he O
may O
never O
see O
the O
whole O
group O
, O
he O
sees O
only O
his O
co-workers O
, O
his O
relatives O
and O
his O
friends O
, O
the O
group O
of O
people O
familiar O
to O
him O
; O
add O
up O
all O
the O
people O
in O
this O
group O
and O
they O
may O
number O
200 B-CARDINAL
, O
and O
that O
is O
already O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
. O

Below O
I O
am O
going O
to O
refer O
to O
these O
200 B-CARDINAL
people O
collectively O
as O
" O
his O
uncle O

" O

So O
whenever O
you O
discuss O
an O
economic O
theory O
with O
someone O
, O
the O
response O
of O
a O
perfectly O
ordinary O
person O
would O
be O
: O
My O
uncle O
is O
n't O
like O
that O
, O
so O
this O
theory O
is O
baloney O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
everybody O
tends O
to O
mistake O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
. O

Here O
, O
mistaking O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
is O
not O
derogatory O
; O
it O
is O
a O
limitation O
of O
the O
human O
race O
itself O
; O
you O
have O
it O
and O
I O
have O
it O
. O

If O
Americans B-NORP
had O
learned O
not O
to O
mistake O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
, O
they O
might O
not O
have O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
of O
the O
world O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
they O
made O
such O
a O
complete O
mess O
of O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
to O
a O
very O
large O
extent O
because O
they O
applied O
their O
own O
common O
sense O
to O
understanding O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East I-LOC
, O
which O
is O
a O
completely O
different O
place O
from O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE
. O

On O
this O
issue O
, O
China B-GPE
does O
not O
have O
much O
basis O
for O
being O
self O
- O
congratulatory O
; O
China B-GPE
's O
rapid O
rise O
has O
even O
caused O
some O
people O
to O
have O
a O
sort O
of O
misconception O
- O
that O
whatever O
China B-GPE
does O
is O
right O
- O
and O
this O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
manifestation O
of O
narrow O
- O
mindedness O
. O

Therefore O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
extremely O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
one O
's O
own O
knowledge O
has O
limitations O
. O

We O
need O
to O
maintain O
a O
sufficiently O
open O
attitude O
toward O
things O
that O
do O
n't O
correspond O
to O
our O
common O
sense O
. O

So O
just O
because O
every O
time O
your O
uncle O
goes O
to O
the O
supermarket O
he O
buys O
hog O
head O
meat O
does O
n't O
mean O
that O
we O
should O
immediately O
assume O
that O
any O
theory O
that O
does O
not O
predict O
people O
going O
to O
the O
supermarket O
will O
buy O
hog O
head O
meat O
is O
wrong O
. O

When O
you O
feel O
other O
people O
are O
talking O
baloney O
, O
and O
what O
other O
people O
say O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
your O
" O
common O
sense O
, O
" O
you O
should O
at O
the O
same O
time O
recognize O
that O
your O
uncle O
is O
only O
your O
uncle O
, O
he O
is O
not O
the O

the O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
silent O
majority O
of O
these O
Moslems B-NORP
are O
not O
part O

The O

perhaps O

Suicide O

not O
a O

they O
have O
been O
made O
popular O
, O
if O
I O

use O
this O
expression O
, O
only O
lately O
. O

Even O
after O
September B-EVENT
11 I-EVENT
, O
it O
seems O
that O
most O

the B-LOC
Western I-LOC

does O
not O
yet O
understand O
this O

It O

a O
very O

Its O
real O

relatively O
minor O

The O
total O
number O

much O
smaller O

September O

all O
the O

It O
is O
always O

great O

One O
such O
murder O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
hysterical O

can O
destroy O

it O
did O
in O

But O
the O
real O
fear O
comes O
from O
the O
undisputed O
fact O
that O
no O
defense O

no O

succeed O

the O

Like O
in O
the O
case O
of O

, O
it O
is O
crucial O
that O
the O

it O

crucial O
to O
reach O

You O
can O
not O

many O
are O

some O
try O

explain O
it O
away O
by O
poverty O

The B-GPE

it O
well O

I O
am O
very O
much O
afraid O
that O
most O
of O
Europe B-LOC
still O
does O
not O
understand O
it O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
Europe B-LOC
will O
understand O
it O
only O
after O
suicide O
murders O
arrive O
in O
Europe B-LOC
in O
a O
big O
way O
. O

In O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
this O
will O
definitely O
happen O
. O

The O
Spanish B-NORP
trains O
and O
the O
Istanbul B-GPE
bombings O
are O
only O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
unity O
of O
the O
Civilized O
World O
in O
fighting O
this O
horror O
is O
absolutely O
indispensable O
. O

Until O
Europe B-LOC
wakes O
up O
, O
this O
unity O
will O
not O
be O
achieved O
. O

*2 O

be O
lethal O

It O
is O
often O
said O
that O
politicians O
, O
diplomats O
and O
perhaps O
also O
lawyers O
and O
business O
people O
must O
sometimes O
lie O
, O
as O
part O
of O
their O
professional O
life O
. O

But O
the O
norms O
of O
politics O
and O
diplomacy O
are O
childish O
, O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
level O
of O
incitement O
and O
total O
absolute O
deliberate O
fabrications O

which O
have O
reached O
new O
heights O
in O
the O

we O
are O
talking O
about O
. O

An O
incredible O
number O
of O
people O
in O
the O
Arab B-NORP

believe O
that O

never O

was O
an O
American B-NORP
provocation O

, O
even O
better O
, O
a O
Jewish B-NORP

You O
all O
remember O
the O
Iraqi O
Minister O

, O
Mr. O
Mouhamad B-PERSON
Said I-PERSON
al-Sahaf I-PERSON

his O

already O
inside O
Baghdad B-GPE

Disinformation O
at O
time O

an O
accepted O
tactic O

But O
to O
stand O
, O
day O

to O
make O
such O
preposterous O

without O

can O
only O
happen O
in O
this O

Mr. O
Sahaf B-PERSON
eventually O
became O
a O
popular O
icon O
as O
a O

this O
did O
not O
stop O
some O

It O
also O
does O
not O

the O

even O

After O
all O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
an O
anti-Semite O
, O
there O
are O
subtle O
ways O
of O
doing O
it O
. O

You O
do O
not O
have O
to O
claim O
that O
the O

that O
the O

The O

also O
by O

These O
words O
are O
much O
more O
dangerous O
than O
many O

realize O

They O
provide O
an O
emotional O
infrastructure O
for O
atrocities O

It O
was O
Joseph B-PERSON
Goebbels I-PERSON
who O
said O
that O
if O
you O
repeat O

people O
will O
believe O
it O

*3 O
. O



Huge O
amounts O
of O
money O

which O
could O
have O
solved O
many O
social O
problems O
in O
this O
dysfunctional O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
are O
channeled O
into O
three B-CARDINAL
concentric O
spheres O
supporting O
death O
and O
murder O
. O

In O
the O
inner O
circle O
are O
the O
terrorists O
themselves O

The O
money O

, O
hideouts O
and O
permanent O
search O
for O
soft O
vulnerable O
targets O
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
are O
primarily O
financed O
by O
terrorist O
states O
like O
Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
, O
until O
recently O
also O
by O

Libya B-GPE
and O
earlier O
also O
by O
some O
of O
the O
Communist B-NORP
regimes O
. O

These O
states O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Authority I-ORG
, O
are O
the O
safe O
havens O
of O
the O
wholesale O
murder O
vendors O
. O

They O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
second B-ORDINAL
wider O
circle O
of O
direct O
supporters O

usually O
a O
very O
comfortable O
living O
, O
by O
serving O
as O
terror O
infrastructure O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
find O
the O
third B-ORDINAL
circle O
of O
so O
- O
called O
religious O
, O
educational O
and O
welfare O
organizations O
, O
which O
actually O
do O
some O
good O
, O
feed O
the O
hungry O

provide O
some O
schooling O

brainwash O
a O
new O
generation O
with O
hatred O
, O
lies O
and O
ignorance O
. O

This O
circle O
operates O
mostly O
through O
mosques O
, O
madrasas O
and O
other O
religious O
establishments O
but O
also O
through O
inciting O
electronic O
and O
printed O
media O
. O

It O
is O
this O
circle O
that O
makes O
sure O
that O
women O
remain O
inferior O
, O
that O
democracy O
is O
unthinkable O
and O
that O
exposure O
to O
the O
outside O

is O
minimal O

It O
is O
also O
that O
circle O

leads O
the O
way O
in O
blaming O
everybody O

the O
Moslem B-NORP

for O
the O
miseries O

largely O
financed O

they O
are O
infested O

the O
outer O

The O
Saudi B-NORP
regime O

of O

will O
be O
the O
next O
victim O

major O
terror O

when O
the O
inner O
circle O
will O
explode O
into O
the O
outer O
circle O

The O
Saudis B-NORP

beginning O

they O

the O
outer O
circle O

Figuratively O
speaking O
, O
this O
outer O
circle O
is O
the O
guardian O

which O
makes O
sure O

Some O
parts O

Every O

how O
you O
prevent O

Other O
aspects O

Can O

Can O

But O
now O
we O
have O
an O
entire O

Do O
you O

which O
serves O

a O

ammunition O

if O
you O

Do O
you O
storm O

taken O
over O

took O
the O
priests O

? O

Do O
you O
search O
every O
ambulance O
after O
a O
few O
suicide O
murderers O
use O
ambulances O
to O
reach O
their O
targets O
? O

Do O
you O
strip O
every O
woman O
because O
one O
pretended O
to O
be O
pregnant O
and O
carried O
a O
suicide O
bomb O
on O
her O
belly O
? O

Do O
you O

you O
, O
standing O
deliberately O
behind O
a O

Do O
you O
raid O
terrorist O
headquarters O
, O
hidden O
in O
a O
mental O
hospital O
? O

Do O
you O
shoot O
an O
arch-murderer O
who O
deliberately O
moves O
from O
one O
location O
to O
another O
, O
always O
surrounded O
by O
children O
? O

All O
of O
these O
happen O
daily O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
in O
the O
Palestinian B-NORP
areas O
. O

What O
do O
you O
do O
? O

Well O
, O
you O
do O
not O
want O
to O
face O
the O
dilemma O
. O

But O
it O
can O
not O
be O
avoided O
. O



Suppose O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
discussion O
, O
that O
someone O
would O
openly O
stay O
in O
a O

Teheran B-GPE

promising O

more O

while O
the B-ORG
Government I-ORG

issues O
public O
condemnations O
of O
his O

continues O

him O
, O
invite O
him O
to O
official O
functions O
and O
treat O
him O
as O
a O
great O
dignitary O
. O

I O
leave O
it O
to O
you O
as O
homework O
to O
figur O
out O
what O
Spain B-GPE
or O
France B-GPE
would O
have O
done O
, O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
is O
still O
having O
illusions O
about O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
in O
a O
totally O
lawless O
environment O
. O

It O
is O
trying O
to O
play O
ice O
hockey O
by O
sending O
a O
ballerina O
ice O
- O
skater O
into O
the O
ring O
or O
to O
knock O
out O
a O
heavyweight O
boxer O
by O
a O
chess O
player O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
that O
no O
country O
has O
a O
law O
against O
cannibals O
eating O
its O
prime O
minister O
, O
because O
such O
an O
act O
is O
unthinkable O
, O
international O
law O
does O
not O
address O
killers O
shooting O
from O
hospitals O
, O
mosques O
and O
ambulances O
, O
while O
being O
protected O
by O
their O
Government O
or O
society O
. O

International O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
handle O
someone O
who O
sends O
children O
to O
throw O
stones O
, O
stands O
behind O
them O
and O
shoots O
with O
immunity O
and O
can O
not O
be O
arrested O
because O
he O
is O
sheltered O
by O
a O
Government O
. O

International O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
leader O
of O
murderers O
who O
is O
royally O
and O
comfortably O
hosted O
by O
a O
country O
, O
which O
pretends O
to O
condemn O
his O
acts O
or O
just O
claims O
to O
be O
too O
weak O
to O
arrest O
him O
. O

The O
amazing O
thing O
is O
that O
all O
of O
these O
crooks O
demand O
protection O
under O
international O
law O
, O
and O
define O
all O
those O
who O
attack O
them O
as O
`` O
war O
criminals O
, O
'' O
with O
some O
Western O
media O
repeating O
the O
allegations O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
all O
of O
this O
is O
temporary O
, O

because O
the O
evolution O
of O
international O
law O
has O
always O
adapted O
itself O
to O
reality O
. O

The O
punishment O
for O
suicide O
murder O
should O
be O
death O
or O
arrest O
before O
the O
murder O
, O
not O
during O
and O
not O
after O
. O

After O
every O
world O
war O
, O
the O
rules O
of O
international O
law O
have O
changed O
, O
and O
the O
same O
will O
happen O
after O
the O
present O
one O
. O

But O
during O
the O
twilight O
zone O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
harm O
can O
be O
done O
. O

The O
picture O
I O
described O
here O
is O
not O
pretty O
. O

What O
can O
we O
do O
about O
it O
? O

In O
the O
short O
run O
, O
only O
fight O
and O
win O
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
only O
educate O
the O
next O
generation O
and O
open O
it O
to O
the O
world O
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
can O
and O
must O
be O
destroyed O
by O
force O
. O

The O
outer O
circle O
can O
not O
be O
eliminated O
by O
force O
. O

Here O
we O
need O
financial O
starvation O
of O
the O
organizing O
elite O
, O
more O
power O
to O
women O
, O
more O
education O
, O
counter-propaganda O
, O
boycott O
whenever O
feasible O
and O
access O
to O
Western O
media O
, O
internet O
and O
the O
international O
scene O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
we O
need O
a O
total O
absolute O
unity O
and O
determination O
of O
the O
civilized O
world O
against O
all O
three B-CARDINAL
circles O
of O
evil O
. O

Allow O
me O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
to O
depart O
from O
my O
alleged O
role O
as O
a O
taxi O
driver O
and O
return O
to O
science O
. O

When O
you O
have O
a O
malignant O
tumor O
, O
you O
may O
remove O
the O
tumor O
itself O
surgically O
. O

You O
may O
also O
starve O
it O
by O
preventing O
new O
blood O
from O
reaching O
it O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
, O
thereby O
preventing O
new O
`` O
supplies O
'' O
from O
expanding O
the O
tumor O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
is O
best O
to O
do O
both O
. O

But O
before O
you O
fight O
and O
win O
, O
by O
force O
or O
otherwise O
, O
you O
have O
to O
realize O
that O
you O
are O
in O
a O
war O
, O
and O
this O
may O
take O
Europe B-LOC
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
more I-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
first B-ORDINAL
eliminate O
the O
terrorist O
regimes O
, O
so O
that O
no O
Government O
in O
the O
world O
will O
serve O
as O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
these O
people O
. O

I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
comment O
here O
on O
whether O
the O
American B-NORP
- O
led O
attack O
on O
Iraq B-GPE
was O
justified O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
or O
any O
other O
pre-war O
argument O
, O
but O
I O
can O
look O
at O
the O
post-war O
map O
of O
Western B-LOC
Asia I-LOC
. O

Now O
that O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
Libya B-GPE
are O
out O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
half I-CARDINAL
terrorist O
states O
remain O
: O
Iran B-GPE
, O
Syria B-GPE
and O
Lebanon B-GPE
, O
the O
latter O
being O
a O
Syrian B-NORP
colony O
. O

Perhaps O
Sudan B-GPE
should O
be O
added O
to O
the O
list O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
conquest O
of O
Afghanistan B-GPE
and O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
both O
Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
are O
now O
totally O
surrounded O
by O
territories O
unfriendly O
to O
them O
. O

Iran B-GPE
is O
encircled O
by O
Afghanistan B-GPE
, O
by O
the B-GPE
Gulf I-GPE
States I-GPE
, O
Iraq B-GPE
and O
the O
Moslem B-NORP
republics O
of O
the O
former O
Soviet B-GPE
Union I-GPE
. O

Syria B-GPE
is O
surrounded O
by O
Turkey B-GPE
, O
Iraq B-GPE
, O
Jordan B-GPE
and O
Israel B-GPE
. O

This O
is O
a O
significant O
strategic O
change O
and O
it O
applies O
strong O
pressure O
on O
the O
terrorist O
countries O
. O

It O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
Iran B-GPE
is O
so O
active O
in O
trying O
to O
incite O
a O
Shiite B-NORP
uprising O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
American B-NORP
plan O
was O
actually O
to O
encircle O
both O
Iran B-GPE
and O
Syria B-GPE
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
resulting O
situation O
. O

In O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
the O
number O
one B-CARDINAL
danger O
to O
the O
world O
today O
is O
Iran B-GPE
and O
its O
regime O
. O

It O
definitely O
has O
ambitions O
to O
rule O
vast O
areas O
and O
to O
expand O
in O
all O
directions O
. O

It O
has O
an O
ideology O
which O
claims O
supremacy O
over O
Western O
culture O
. O

It O
is O
ruthless O
. O

It O
has O
proven O
that O
it O
can O
execute O
elaborate O
terrorist O
acts O
without O
leaving O
too O
many O
traces O
, O
using O
Iranian B-NORP
Embassies O
. O

It O
is O
clearly O
trying O
to O
develop O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

Its O
so O
- O
called O
moderates O
and O
conservatives O
play O
their O
own O

version O
of O
the O
`` O

game O

Iran B-GPE
sponsors O
Syrian B-NORP
terrorism O
, O

it O
is O
certainly O
behind O
much O
of O
the O
action O
in O
Iraq B-GPE
, O

it O
is O
fully O

at O

in O
Europe B-LOC

in O

America I-LOC

probably O
also O
in O
Uzbekistan B-GPE

Saudi B-GPE

it O
truly O
leads O

try O

important O

No O

ever O
know O
whether O
the O

would O
have O
yielded O
a O

a B-DATE
few I-DATE

earlier I-DATE
. O

But O
it O
really O
does O
not O
matter O
. O

What O
matters O
is O
that O
the O
terrorists O
believe O
that O
they O
caused O
the O
result O
and O
that O
they O
won O
by O
driving O
Spain B-GPE
out O
of O
Iraq B-GPE
. O

The O
Spanish B-NORP
story O
will O
surely O
end O
up O
being O
extremely O
costly O
to O
other O
European B-NORP
countries O
, O
including O
France B-GPE
, O
who O
is O
now O
expelling O
inciting O

forbidding O

including O
others O
who O
sent O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
Spain B-GPE
itself O
will O
pay O
even O
more O
. O

Is O
the O
solution O
a O
democratic O
Arab B-NORP
world O
? O

If O
by O
democracy O
we O
mean O
free O
elections O
but O
also O
free O
press O
, O
free O
speech O
, O
a O
functioning O
judicial O
system O
, O
civil O
liberties O
, O
equality O
to O
women O
, O
free O
international O

avoidance O
of O
lawless O
behavior O
regarding O

and O
children O
, O
then O
yes O
, O
democracy O
is O
the O
solution O
. O

If O
democracy O
is O
just O
free O
elections O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
most O
fanatic O
regime O
will O
be O
elected O
, O
the O
one O
whose O
incitement O
and O
fabrications O
are O
the O
most O
inflammatory O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
it O
already O
in O
Algeria B-GPE
and O
, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
, O
in O
Turkey B-GPE
. O

It O
will O
happen O
again O
, O
if O
the O
ground O
is O
not O
prepared O
very O
carefully O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
a O
certain O
transition O
democracy O
, O
as O
in O
Jordan B-GPE
, O
may O
be O
a O
better O
temporary O
solution O
, O
paving O
the O
way O
for O
the O
real O
thing O
, O
perhaps O
in O
the O
same O
way O
that O
an O
immediate O
sudden O
democracy O
did O
not O
work O
in O
Russia B-GPE
and O
would O
not O
have O
worked O
in O
China B-GPE
. O

I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
will O
prevail O
. O

But O
the O
longer O
it O
takes O
us O
to O
understand O
the O
new O
landscape O
of O
this O

the O
more O

painful O

, O
you O

the O

trying O

horrible O

horrible O

you O

, O
one B-CARDINAL

stood O
up O

talked O

some O

what O
? O

the O

Murdoch B-PERSON
has O
lobbied O

They O
would O
allow O

Let O
's O
talk O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
about O
what O
the O
Navy B-ORG
does O
to O
prevent O
such O
tragedies O
. O

We O
were O
talking O
about O
it O
this B-TIME
morning I-TIME
and O
we O
put O
together O
some O
graphics O
for O
you O
. O

I O
'll O
try O
to O
explain O
it O
the O
best O
I O
can O
from O
what O
I O
remember O
from O
being O
on O
the B-PRODUCT
`` I-PRODUCT
USS I-PRODUCT
Abraham I-PRODUCT
Lincoln I-PRODUCT
'' I-PRODUCT
. O

This O
is O
an O
amphibious O
ship O
, O
rather O
, O
but O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Navy B-ORG
does O
with O
regard O
to O
prevention O
. O

, O
every O
sailor O
that O
's O
entering O
the O
Navy B-ORG
does O
take O
a O
swim O
test O
. O

They O
learn O
how O
to O
tread O
water O
and O
do O
the O
dead O
man O
float O
and O
they O
have O
to O
pass O
that O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
on O
. O

Also O
drills O
take O
place O
before O
sailors O
get O
on O
to O
any O
ship O
, O
before O
any O
deployment O
. O

Usually O
twice O
a O
day O
, O
they O
're O
practicing O
man O
overboard O
drills O
, O
knowing O
where O
to O
go O
, O
where O
to O
report O
to O
if O
indeed O
a O
man O
overboard O
takes O
place O
and O
as O
the O
deployment O
begins O
, O
those O
wane O
off O
, O
but O
they O
know O
where O
to O
go O
quickly O
. O

They O
also O
wear O
float O
coats O
. O

You O
can O
see O
them O
here O
. O

The O
yellow O
shirt O
is O
wearing O
a O
yellow O
float O
coat O
. O

Everything O
is O
color O
coordinated O
. O

You O
see O
the O
gentleman O
here O
wearing O
a O
brown O
one O
and O
they O
have O
toggles O
to O
pull O
and O
inflate O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
manual O
device O
so O
if O
the O
toggles O
do O
n't O
work O
they O
can O
blow O
air O
into O
the O
inflation O
device O
. O

They O
have O
dive O
goggles O
and O
they O
're O
able O
to O
find O
them O
. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
strobe O
light O
and O
a O
whistle O
. O

Also O
such O
location O
devices O
, O
some O
ships O
have O
smoke O
floats O
they O
can O
toss O
out O
so O
the O
man O
overboard O
will O
be O
able O
to O
use O
smoke O
signals O
as O
a O
way O
of O
trying O
to O
, O
let O
the O
rescuer O
locate O
them O
. O

Also O
24 B-CARDINAL
/ O
7 O
there O
are O
individuals O
on O
watch O
, O
all O
throughout O
the O
ship O
, O
all O
around O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
indeed O
, O
there O
is O
netting O
on O
most O
parts O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
not O
all O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
but O
on O
most O
parts O
there O
is O
a O
very O
thick O
netting O
. O

Now O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
man O
overboard O
rescue O
and O
when O
indeed O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
situation O
. O

You O
will O
hear O
a O
P.A. O
announcement O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
so O
everyone O
knows O
they O
have O
to O
react O
quickly O
. O

A O
ship O
- O
wide O
search O
will O
happen O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
person O
go O
overboard O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
they O
do O
see O
someone O
go O
overboard O
, O
the O
ship O
starts O
to O
circle O
that O
area O
continuously O
. O

Also O
small O
boats O
sometimes O
go O
out O
into O
the O
water O
, O
but O
even O
more O
importantly O
, O
helicopters O
are O
launched O
immediately O
. O

Inside O
those O
helicopters O
rescue O
swimmers O
. O

If O
indeed O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
located O
, O
well O
the O
hoister O
is O
dropped O
down O
with O
usually O
a O
torso O
harness O
. O

If O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
injured O
then O
they O
may O
use O
a O
basket O
, O
but O
more O
than O
likely O
those O
swimmers O
will O
go O
right O
into O
the O
water O
and O
try O
and O
help O
the O
swimmer O
hook O
up O
on O
that O
harness O
and O
pull O
them O
up O
into O
the O
helo O
and O
pull O
them O
back O
on O
to O
the O
ship O
for O
treatment O
and O
usually O
a O
search O
takes O
about B-TIME
24 I-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

The O
search O
crews O
will O
go O
24 B-TIME
hours I-TIME
before O
calling O
off O
that O
search O
. O

Why O
call O
it O
off O
? O

There O
's O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
to O
look O
at O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
water O
temperature O
, O
it O
's O
very O
common O
in O
cold O
water O
that O
someone O
will O
not O
survive O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

Also O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
24 B-TIME
- I-TIME
hour I-TIME
search O
is O
they O
fail O
they O
've O
exhausted O
all O
resources O
by O
that O
time O
. O

Anyway O
, O
we O
'll O
continue O
to O
follow O
what O
's O
happening O
on O
the B-PRODUCT
`` I-PRODUCT
USS I-PRODUCT
Nassau I-PRODUCT
'' I-PRODUCT
as O
those O
investigations O
continue O
for O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
missing O

The O

the O

does O
n't O
go O
far O
enough O
. O

A O
better O
one O
might O

blew O
the O

we O

brief O
all O

that O

guess O
you O
were O
asked O
should O

concede O

you O
answered O
, O
the O
Vice O
President O
should O
do O
what O
's O
best O
for O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE

Is O
that O
what O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
say O
? O

Well O
, O
sure O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
that O
all O
the O
people O
involved O
in O
this O
unique O
situation O
, O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O

contested O
, O
Brian B-PERSON
, O
need O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
as O
they O
see O
fit O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
judge O
there O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
just O
giving O
out O
his O
ruling O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
court O
session O
today B-DATE
, O
he O
went O
on O
beyond O
the O
basic O
issues O
and O
added O
reason O
upon O
reason O
for O
why O
he O
turned O
down O
the O
Gore B-PERSON
case O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
his O
method O
there O
was O
to O
try O
to O
make O
this O
more O
or O
less O
appeal O
proof O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
what O
he O
did O
was O
addressed O
the O
situation O
as O
it O
exists O
in O
Florida B-GPE
and O
addressed O
the O
contingencies O
that O
were O
raised O
in O
the O
voluminous O

that O
he O
had O
, O
not O
only O
from O
the O
two B-CARDINAL
party O
candidates O
involved O
, O
but O
also O
of O
the O
interveners O
who O
were O
in O
the O
case O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
the O
Democratic B-NORP
line O

they O
wo O
n't O
be O
happy O
until O
every O
vote O
is O
counted O
, O
and O
we O
could O
n't O
help O
but O
notice O
, O
should O
we O
call O
it O
a O
rhetorical O
device O
you O
used O
when O
talking O
to O

this B-TIME

Pause O
and O
listen O
along O

to O
the O
following O

Those O
ballots O
have O
been O
counted O
not O
once O
on O

night I-TIME
but O
twice O
in O
the O

and O
how O
many O
did O
you O
say O
there O
were O
? O

10,750 B-CARDINAL
-- O

If O
you O
know O
the O
exact O
number O
, O
does O
n't O
that O
mean O
they O
've O
been O
counted O
? O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
suppose O
that O
was O
any O
accident O
on O
your O
part O
? O

Well O
, O
they O
have O
been O
making O
this O
point O
throughout O
these O
proceedings O
that O
these O
ballots O
have O
never O
been O
counted O
, O
and O
that O
is O
factually O
not O
true O

They O
have O
been O

on O

-- O
they O
've O
been O
counted O
in O

it O
simply O
happens O

I O
believe O

it O

What O
we O

A O
nationalist O

legitimacy O
to O
Kostunica B-PERSON
but O
of O
course O
at O
a O
price O

It O
means O
that O
the O

the O

it O

always O
a O
danger O
that O
somebody O

get O
hurt O
in O

that O
is O
a O
danger O

every O

to O
face O

is O
quite O
an O
interesting O
writer O
because O
in O
some O
senses O
he O
differs O
from O
the O
great O
cohort O
of O
contemporary O
Chinese B-NORP
writers O
that O
are O
well O
known O
in O
the O
West B-LOC
today O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
great O
difference O
about O
Gao B-PERSON
Xingjian I-PERSON
is O
that O
he O
actually O
received O
a O
university O
education O
. O

He O
was O
educated O
in O
French B-LANGUAGE
, O
so O
has O
a O
very O
good O
knowledge O
of O
French B-NORP
literature O
and O
it O
is O
very O
much O
French B-NORP
literature O
that O
has O
influenced O
his O
own O
literary O
creativities O
, O
only O
free O
production O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
conservative O
Chinese B-NORP
critics O
would O
accuse O
him O
of O
blind O
worship O
of O
Western B-NORP
models O
. O

Sartre B-PERSON
is O
a O
big O
man O
in O
Mr. O
Xingjian B-PERSON
's O
life O
, O
is O
n't O
he O
? O

I O
would O
say O
so O
that O
Sartre B-PERSON
has O
been O
a O
quite O
a O
big O
influence O
. O

I O
think O
the O
other O
influences O
would O
be O
Samuel B-PERSON
Beckett I-PERSON
, O
the O
Irish B-LANGUAGE
and O
French B-LANGUAGE
language O
writer O
, O
Unesco B-PERSON
. O

These O
are O
models O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
all O
of O
these O
writers O
are O
writers O
who O
were O
active O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
half I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
twentieth I-DATE
century I-DATE
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
very O
interesting O
because O
Mr. O
Gao B-PERSON
left O
China B-GPE
before O
Tianenmen B-EVENT
. O

He O
wrote O
a O
play O
, O
in O
particular O
about O
the O
events O
there O
. O

Would O
you O
say O
that O
his O
influences O
may O
be O
more O
French B-NORP
literary O
then O
they O
were O
his O
own O
immediate O
life O
experience O
? O

I O
would O
say O
both O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
because O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
play O
that O
he O
wrote O
that O
made O
him O
famous O
was O
a O
play O
that O
dates O
from O
1981 B-DATE
, O
which O
was O
actually O
called O
` B-WORK_OF_ART
Bus I-WORK_OF_ART
Stop I-WORK_OF_ART
' I-WORK_OF_ART
, O
which O
many O
people O
said O
or O
had O
resonances O
from O
Beckett B-PERSON
's O
play O
` O
Waiting B-WORK_OF_ART
for I-WORK_OF_ART
Godot I-WORK_OF_ART
' O
and O
it O
concerned O
a O
number O
of O
Chinese B-NORP
people O
from O
different O
walks O
of O
life O
who O
were O
standing O
at O
a O
bus O
stop O
waiting O
for O
a O
bus O
that O
never O
came O
. O

So O
, O
we O
can O
see O
immediately O
that O
the O
resonances O
with O
the O
play O
of O
Beckett B-PERSON
, O
but O
Gao B-PERSON
Xingjian I-PERSON
really O
before O
1989 B-DATE
felt O
, O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
write O
and O
to O
have O
his O
plays O
produced O
, O
as O
he O
would O
wish O
, O
and O
so O
left O
China B-GPE
couple B-DATE
of I-DATE
years I-DATE
before O
the O
incident O
at O
Tiananmen B-FAC
in O
1989 B-DATE
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
a B-DATE
great I-DATE
day I-DATE
for O
modern O
Chinese B-NORP
literature O
and O
it O
is O
a B-DATE
day I-DATE
that O
has O
been O
awaited O
for O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
60 I-DATE
to I-DATE
70 I-DATE
years I-DATE

The O

to O
demand O

So O
what O
happened O
here O
, O
can O
you O
tell O
me O
? O

We O
set O
a O

not O

We O

what O

Nearly B-DATE
four I-DATE

bloodiest O

the O

gone O

worse O

President O

vitriolic O
attacks O

west O
combined O
with O
continuing O
lawlessness O

Zimbabwe B-GPE

Many O

us O
like O
to O
characterize O
Zimbabwe B-GPE
's O
crisis O
as O
an O
economic O
crisis O
but O
it O
is O
wider O

deeper O

Simba B-PERSON

sounds O

In O

, O
he O

You O
can O

the O

go O
up O

you O
can O
see O
your O
bus O

go O
up O

you O
can O
see O
companies O
closing O
down O
or O
working O
short O
weeks O
and O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
, O
but O
you O
can O
also O
read O
Zimbabwe B-GPE
's O
crisis O
in O
the O
number O
of O
destitute O
people O

on O
the O
tobacco O
auction O
floors O

This O
year O
's O
crop O
is O
down O
because O
of O
the O
continuing O
occupation O
of O
white O

. O

When O
the B-DATE
selling I-DATE
season I-DATE
ends O
next B-DATE
month I-DATE
, O
foreign O
exchange O
reserves O
, O
hardly O
estimated O
to O
cover O
just B-DATE
a I-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
of O
imports O
, O
are O
likely O
to O
completely O
dry O
up O

Without O
them O
, O
paying O
for O
central O
imports O
such O
as O
fuel O
and O
electricity O
will O
become O
even O
more O
difficult O
. O

What O
we O
have O
right O
now O
is O
a O
political O
crisis O
and O
until O
that O
political O
crisis O
is O
resolved O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
the O
economy O
is O
going O
to O
improve O
. O

The O
sentiments O
of O
economist O
Howard B-PERSON
Setoli I-PERSON
are O
widely O
shared O
. O

With O
eighteen B-DATE
months I-DATE
to O
go O
until O
scheduled O
presidential O
elections O
, O
Zimbabwe B-GPE
is O
headed O
for O
complete O
economic O
ruin O
. O

If O
government O
continues O
on O
its O
current O
path O
, O
the O
economy O
will O
continue O
to O
contract O
. O

This B-DATE
year I-DATE
it O
was O
expected O
to O
contract O
by O
8 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT

Next B-DATE
year I-DATE
we O
see O
a O
further O
contraction O
of O
12 B-PERCENT

So O
we O
are O
talking O
of O
massive O
unemployment O

severe O
foreign O

It O
is O
an O

who O
won O

in O
a O

we O

enter O
the O
musical O
question O
, O
who O
let O
the O
dogs O
out O
? O

First B-ORDINAL
up O
we O
have O
the O
answer O
to O
our O
geo O
quiz O
today B-DATE
. O

We O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
region O
of O
central O
Italy B-GPE
bordering O
the B-LOC
Adriatic I-LOC
Sea I-LOC
. O

The O
area O
is O
mostly O
mountainous O
and O
includes O
Mt. B-LOC
Corno I-LOC
, O
the O
highest O
peak O
of O
the O
Apennines B-LOC
. O

It O
also O
includes O
a O
lot O
of O
sheep O
, O
good O
clean O
- O
living O
, O
healthy O
sheep O
, O
and O
an O
Italian B-NORP
entrepreneur O
has O
an O
idea O
about O
how O
to O
make O
a O
little O
money O
of O
them O
. O

The O
answer O
is O
Abruzzo B-GPE
. O

Journalist O
Carlos B-PERSON
Depalazai I-PERSON
was O
in O
Rome B-GPE
, O
Italy B-GPE
and O
Carlo B-PERSON
how O
does O
this O
fellow O
plan O
to O
profit O
from O
the O
sheep O
of O
the O
Abruzzo B-GPE
? O

He O
is O
taking O
advantage O
of O
two B-CARDINAL
crazes O
that O
we O
are O
having O
in O
the O
Italy B-GPE
at O
the O
moment O
, O
one B-CARDINAL
is O
internet O
, O
the O
other O
one B-CARDINAL
is O
the O
awareness O
on O
food O
. O

So O
this O
guy O
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
people O
adopting O
sheep O
by O
an O
internet O
. O

So O
you O
can O
have O
access O
through O
your O
computer O
on O
your O
desk O
. O

Go O
to O
the O
web O
site O
of O
these O
guys O
and O
you O
can O
have O
look O
at O
the O
face O
of O
sheep O
which O
are O
available O
to O
be O
adopted O
. O

So O
what O
does O
it O
mean O
to O
adopt O
a O
sheep O
, O
to O
show O
up O
on O
your O
back O
step O
or O
do O
you O
, O
somehow O
keep O
track O
of O
its O
progress O
on O
the O
farm O
in O
Italy B-GPE
? O

You O
are O
not O
actually O
adopting O
the O
sheep O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
can O
have O
it O
with O
you O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
distant O
adoption O
, O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
actually O
have O
the O
child O
in O
your O
home O
. O

You O
are O
just O
contributing O
with O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
money O
and O
you O
are O
monitoring O
the O
growing O
up O
. O

It O
works O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
so O
you O
have O
access O
on O
the O
web O
site O
of O
this O
little O
farm O
, O
in O
a O
little O
village O
of O
Abrutzi B-GPE
and O
you O
can O
choose O
among O
many O
, O
many O
sheeps O
and O
after O
contributing O
with O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
money O
the O
sheep O
is O
actually O
yours O
. O

All O
right O
, O
so O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
you O
have O
mentioned O
to O
us O
is O
about B-MONEY
160 I-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY
and O
for O
that O
you O
get O
more O
than O
just O
a O
warm O
and O
fuzzy O
feeling O
. O

You O
can O
also O
receive O
leggings O
that O
are O
made O
from O
wool O
of O
the O
sheep O
and O
even O
if O
you O
like O
some O
of O
the O
sheep O
dropping O
delivered O
to O
your O
door O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
mean O
this O
is O
quite O
funny O
, O
but O
apart O
from O
all O
the O
details O
, O
which O
are O
sometimes O
even O
strange O
I O
think O
what O
is O
really O
important O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
a O
new O
concern O
that O
is O
effecting O
Italian B-NORP
people O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
are O
notoriously O
lover O
of O
good O
food O
. O

We O
have O
a O
generous O
attitude O
towards O
food O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
new O
stuff O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
you O
really O
care O
about O
a O
sheep O
in O
the O
way O
she O
is O
fed O
, O
in O
the O
way O
she O
is O
nurtured O
, O
in O
the O
way O
people O
are O
looking O
after O
it O
, O
because O
it O
's O
a O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
you O
have O
something O
which O
is O
genuine O
on O
your O
table O
up O
the O
end O
. O

Wait O
a B-TIME
minute I-TIME
, O
you O
said O
that O
on O
your O
table O
at O
the O
end O
. O

Yeah O
, O
at O
the O
table O
if O
it O
becomes O
food O
for O
instance O
, O
which O
is O
an O
option O
. O

You O
are O
adopting O
the O
sheep O
and O
whatever O
happens O
at O
the O
end O
it O
's O
your O
choice O
and O
among O
the O
option O
is O
you O
know O
food O
for O
your O
meal O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
puts O
a O
whole O
new O
tone O
to O
this O
thing O
. O

I O
mean O
usually O
when O
you O
think O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
adoption O
that O
means O
saving O
an O
animal O
not O
eventually O
eating O
it O
. O

I O
mean O
this O
is O
an O
option O
which O
is O
available O
and O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
provocation O
. O

You O
know O
Italians B-NORP
now O
mainly O
live O
in O
metropolitan O
areas O
in O
big O
cities O
like O
Rome B-GPE
, O
Florence B-GPE
, O
Naples B-GPE
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
were O
a O
population O
of O
shepherds O
or O
farmers O
. O

We O
had O
completely O
different O
attitude O
towards O
nature O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
we O
are O
losing O
something O
, O
and O
we O
need O
to O
reestablish O
a O
better O
relationship O
with O
nature O
and O
the O
simple O
fact O
that O
the O
Environment O
Minister O
in O
Italy B-GPE
supported O
the O
initiative O
and O
he O
himself O
adopted O
a O
sheep O
is O
significant O
. O

He O
took O
advantage O
immediately O
of O
these O
ideas O
to O
build O
up O
a O
new O
awareness O
and O
a O
new O
attitude O
of O
Italians B-NORP
towards O
nature O
and O
farms O

, O
often O
the O

is O
just O
what O
the O
Florida B-GPE

did O
, O
and O
also O
, O
that O
the B-LAW

it O

Midway O
through O

nothing O
illegal O

It O
simply O

overstepped O

perhaps O
there O
was O

Justice O
Antonin B-PERSON
Scalia I-PERSON
also O
pressed O
Tribe B-PERSON

He O
said O

relied O
on O
the B-LAW
Florida I-LAW

to O
draft O
its O

excluding O
state O
lawmakers O

that O
violated O
the B-LAW
U.S. I-LAW

It O
was O
Justice O

asked O
the O
most O
straightforward O

all O

We O
understand O
since O
Thelma B-PERSON
left O

you O
've O
now O
wittled O
this O
down O
to O
perhaps O
four B-CARDINAL

is O
that O
true O
/? O

Well O
hi O
Paula B-PERSON
/. O

yes O
we O
have O
/. O

Uh O
when O
the O
remains O
came O
in O
a B-DATE
little I-DATE
over I-DATE
a I-DATE

ago I-DATE
our O
analysts O

historians O
got O
to O
work O
on O

they O
were O
able O
to O
wittle O
it O
down O
the O
number O
of O
missing O

to O
a O
few O

at O
this O
point O
they O
've O
wittled O
it O
down O
to O
one B-CARDINAL
aircraft O

a O
missing O
crew O
of O
four B-CARDINAL

we O
've O
gone O

from O
several O

how O

easier O
will O

you O

you O

it O
'll O
help O
quite O
a O
bit O

any O
time O
you O
've O
got O
a O
body O
uh O

remains O

this O
that O
has O
come O

they O
're O

pretty O
good O

it O
's O
mummified O

We O
have O
some O
soft O
tissue O
we O
can O
deal O

so O
we O
can O
look O
at O
the O
color O
of O
the O
hair O

we O
can O
tell O
right O
away O
the O
race O

the O
sex O
of O
the O
individual O

then O
there O
are O
other O

that O
's O

we O
're O

So O
in O
the O
interest O

full O
disclosure O

what O
I O
've O
learned O

one O
would O
think O

you O
've O
got O
it O
now O
narrowed O
down O
to O
four B-CARDINAL

perhaps O
you O
could O
go O
to O
four B-CARDINAL

get O
strands O
of O
hair O

try O
to O
do O
a O

you O
've O

it O
not O

no O
no O
it O
's O
not O
that O
simple O

Um O
one O
thing O
we O
always O
caution O
people O
about O
is O
the O
pool O
of O
aircraft O

missing O

be O
larger O

what O
we O

looking O

what O
we O
want O
to O
do O
is O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
just O
look O
at O
the O
material O
evidence O
that O
we O
have O
and O
immediately O
um O
jump O
to O
a O
conclusion O
that O
this O
is O
a O
certain O
individual O
/. O

What O
we O
want O
to O
do O
is O
have O
the O
evidence O
speak O
for O
itself O
/. O

and O
when O
we O
look O
at O
this O
individual O
as O
we O
've O
done O
the O
biological O
profile O
looking O
at O
his O
remains O
his O
bones O
his O
teeth O
and O
the O
material O
evidence O
/. O

and O
what O
we O
're O
able O
to O
tell O
from O
this O
individual O
is O
that O
he O
died O
in O
his B-DATE
twenties I-DATE
he O
stood O
somewhere O
between O
five B-QUANTITY
foot I-QUANTITY
nine I-QUANTITY

six B-QUANTITY
foot I-QUANTITY
two I-QUANTITY
inches I-QUANTITY
tall O
um O
he O
sustained O
massive O
trauma O

his O

on O
impact O

And O
he O
's O
Caucasoid B-NORP
male O

and O
so O
we O
know O
much O
more O
now O
just B-DATE
one I-DATE
week I-DATE
later I-DATE

what O
we O
did O
when O
he O
came O
in O
about B-DATE
eight I-DATE
days I-DATE

So O
the O
most O
important O
question O
is O
when O
do O
you O
think O
you O
're O
going O

know O
exactly O

that O

most O

we O

you O

the O
answer O

knows O
for O
sure O
exactly O
when O
we O
'll O
identify O
him O

it O
depends O

is O
that O
all O
the O
lines O

together O

successful O

then O
we O

people O
going O

out O

would O

early O
stages O

let O
me O
play O

piece O

was O

loud O
yelling O
coming O

it O
sounded O

cheering O

he O
says O
uh O
later O
um O
chief O
that O
he O
heard O
a O
horrific O
thud O

yeah O
that O
would O
indicate O
that O
something O
did O
go O
on O
there O

we O
know O
uh O

the O
three B-CARDINAL

uh O
with O

the O
question O
that O
has O
to O
be O
uh O
presented O
to O
everybody O
is O
why O
is O
it O
taking O
so O
long O
for O
authorities O
to O
interview O
the O
individual O
that O
was O
in O
a O
cabin O
next O
door O

Mhm O
/. O

Any O
seasoned O
investigator O
would O
know O

you O
would O
want O
to O
conduct O
your O
interviews O
uh O
of O
possible O
witnesses O
immediately O
after O
the O
crime O

Yeah O
/. O

Yeah O
/. O

And O
you O
would O
not O
just O
interview O
that O
individual O
next O
door O

You O
would O
have O
to O
take O
a O
step O

to O
both O
sides O
/. O

Susan B-PERSON
what O
's O
the O
answer O
to O
that O
/? O

Dan B-PERSON
/. O

there O
are O
jurisdictional O
problems O
here O

You O
know O
it O
's O
not O
a O
clear O
cut O
case O

to O
who O
gets O
to O
prosecute O
this O
case O

Jurisdiction O
is O

clear O

but O
they O
're O
working O
very O
hard O
to O
solve O
the O
crime O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
criticism O
is O
well O
placed O
against O
law O
enforcement O
in O
this O
case O
/. O

Also O
the O
crime O
scene O
oh O
if O
you O
want O
to O
call O
it O
that O
was O
cleaned O
up O
by O
the O
cruise O
ship O
who O
got O
their O
investigators O
and O
their O
lawyers O
in O
from O
what O
I O
understand O
right O
away O
to O
make O
this O
go O
away O
/. O

so O
I O
think O
law O
enforcement O
was O
put O
in O
a O
bad O
position O
trying O
to O
play O
catchup O

and O
I O
think O
they O
're O
doing O
+an O
amazing O
job O
/. O

Larry B-PERSON
so O
uh O
any O
chance O
now O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
things O
have O
been O
cleaned O
up O
et O

to O
get O
any O
usable O
evidence O
/? O

Well O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
Dan B-PERSON
/. O

Uh O
obviously O
as O
we O
keep O
saying O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
body O

therefore O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
cause O
or O
a O
manner O
of O
the O
death O
/. O

But O
we O
do O
have O
some O
physical O
evidence O
/. O

Unfortunately O
examination O
of O
the O
photograph O
uh O
tells O
me O
it O
was O
not O
done O
the O
proper O
way O
/. O

It O
was O
n't O
a O
forensic O
photograph O
/. O

So O
I O
really O
do O
not O
know O
how O
large O
the O
stain O
was O
in O
its O
dimensions O
/. O

but O
it O
is O
pretty O
clear O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
blood O
there O
great O
deal O
of O
blood O
/. O

It O
makes O
you O
think O
that O
something O
criminal O
occured O
/. O

But O
again O
getting O
back O
to O
how O
you O
solve O
the O
crime O
you O
got O
to O
go O
to O
the O
crime O
scene O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
there O
are O
multiple O
scenes O
here O
/. O

Every O
place O
there O
's O
blood O
it O
's O
a O
crime O
scene O
/. O

But O
the O
most O
important O
place O
is O
the O
cabin O
because O
that O
's O
presumably O
where O
the O
injury O
took O
place O
/. O

Now O
there O
was O
some O
rumor O
about O
some O
arguments O
going O
casino O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
before I-TIME

Uh O
and O
it O
could O
very O
well O
be O
that O
he O
was O
arguing O
with O
these O
individuals O
/. O

so O
uh O
that O
could O
be O
the O
tie O
the O
connection O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
good O
policework O
would O
connect O
the O
individuals O
in O
question O
with O
the O
casino O
with O

From O

he O
often O
did O
things O

sometimes O
to O
protect O
himself O

sometimes O
to O
take O
care O
of O
his O
family O
. O

Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
just O
corrected O

Ye B-PERSON

should O
not O
be O
called O
Marshal O
Ye B-PERSON
Ting I-PERSON
but O
rather O
General O
Ye B-PERSON
Ting I-PERSON
. O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
General O
Ye B-PERSON
Ting I-PERSON
. O

Why O
, O
is O
there O
a O
big O
difference O
between O
marshal O
and O
general O
? O

Um O
, O
he O
died O
in O
'46 B-DATE
. O

That O
marshal O
, O
afterward O
, O
after O
Liberation B-EVENT
, O
um O
, O
it O
was O
conferred O
on O
him O
, O
so O
only O
then O
-- O

OK O
, O
we O
'll O
call O
him O
General O
Ye B-PERSON
Ting I-PERSON
. O

Mm O
. O



Because O
, O

Very O
naughty O
? O

To O
what O
extent O
were O
you O
naughty O
then O
? O

In O
fact O
I O
was O
a O
very O
well O
- O
behaved O
child O
. O

But O
I O
was O
, O
forced O
into O
it O
, O
, O
if O
you O
were O
n't O
naughty O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
survive O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
forced O
into O
it O
? O

During O
the B-EVENT
Cultural I-EVENT
Revolution I-EVENT
, O
, O
um O
, O
my O
family O
was O
considered O
capitalist O
roaders O
. O

So O
the O
kids O
then O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
with O
you O
, O
or O
they O
would O
tease O
you O
, O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
you O
always O
had O
to O
be O
fighting O
with O
people O
, O
such O
things O
, O

Why O
was O
that O
? O

Was O
it O
because O
people O
for O
example O
would O
say O
that O
your O
father O
was O
such O
and O
such O
, O
or O
your O
family O
was O
such O
and O
such O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
it O
was O
because O
of O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
? O

Right O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
it O
was O
like O
that O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

Because O
you O
had O
to O
face O
them O
alone O
, O
OK O
, O
a O
dozen B-CARDINAL
people O
who O
wanted O
to O
fight O
you O
. O

You O
had O
to O
show O
your O
stuff O
right O
off O
the O
bat O
, O
and O
you O
had O
to O
be O
tough O
. O

So O
that O
was O
, O
the O
only O
way O
you O
could O
overcome O
them O
and O
get O
the O
upper O
hand O
. O

Mm O
. O

Were O
you O
tough O
? O

Mm O
. O

Very O
tough O
. O

Tough O
enough O
to O
-- O

Because O
, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
, O
if O
you O
were O
n't O
tough O
that O
was O
it O
, O
, O
how O
could O
you O
manage O
. O

You O
were O
the O
son O
of O
capitalist O
roaders O
, O
, O
you O
thought O
it O
was O
natural O
to O
be O
the O
object O
of O
bullying O
, O
and O
it O
's O
perfectly O
normal O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
I O
remember O
one O
time O
, O
we O
were O
digging O
out O
an O
air O
- O
raid O
shelter O
, O
that O
-- O

Those O
, O
good O
kids O
, O
they O
went O
there O
and O
threw O
stones O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
dare O
defend O
myself O
, O
so O
I O
just O
had O
to O
endure O
it O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
. O

Mm O
. O

Finally O
a O
very O
big O
rock O
, O
a O
lump O
of O
earth O
, O
hit O
me O
on O
the O
head O
, O
And O
I O
got O
angry O
, O
so O
angry O
that O
I O
rushed O
out O
with O
a O
shovel O
and O
hit O
them O
with O
the O
shovel O
. O

Where O
did O
the O
shovel O
come O
from O
? O

From O
digging O
the O
air O
- O
raid O
shelter O
, O
it O
was O
there O
, O
right O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
you O
picked O
up O
the O
shovel O
and O
rushed O
them O
. O

Did O
you O
crack O
somebody O
's O
head O
open O
? O

Mm O
, O
anyhow O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
cracked O
their O
head O
open O
, O
it O
was O
very O
tragic O
. O

All O
of O
a O
sudden O
nobody O
was O
making O
a O
sound O
. O

Very O
-- O

Once O
I O
fought O
back O
, O
for O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
after O
nobody O
dared O
mess O
with O
me O
. O

How O
many O
of O
them O
did O
you O
take O
out O
? O

I O
hit O
one O
of O
them O
and O
that O
was O
enough O
. O

Nopbody O
went O
to O
get O
the O
schoolmaster O
or O
somebody O
's O
father O
? O

They O
did O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
fuss O
. O

Mm O
. O

Because O
when O
I O
was O
little O
, O
having O
a O
big O
fight O
like O
that O
. O

Mm O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
more O
or O
less O
, O
, O
on O
average O
, O
every O
two B-CARDINAL
years O
I O
changed O
school O
, O
and O
that O
's O
how O
it O
had O
to O
be O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
remember O
one O
time O
-- O
Mm O
, O
also O
, O
when O
I O
was O
in O
fifth B-ORDINAL
or O
sixth B-ORDINAL
grade O
, O
someone O
yelled O
out O
, O
Down O
with O
Ye B-PERSON
Zhengming I-PERSON
, O
he O
was O
yelling O
at O
me O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

Mm O
. O

After O
the O
fight O
I O
went O
home O
, O
and O
my O
father O
was O
standing O
far O
away O
. O

, O
the O
factory O
, O
, O
on O
the O
street O
, O
somebody O
had O
written O
in O
huge O
letters O
Down O
with O
Ye B-PERSON
Zhengming I-PERSON
, O
, O
the O
slogan O
. O

Mm O

I O
got O
accustomed O
to O
it O
while O
passing O
by O
at O
that O
time O
, O
and O
now O
when O
I O
think O
about O
it O
, O
it O
seems O
very O
much O
like O
a O
stage O
play O
. O

Mm O
. O

Back O

a O
movie O
directed O
by O
Ye B-PERSON

Wangjiazhuang B-GPE
, O
right O
. O

This O
is O
obviously O
him O
as O
a O
boy O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
memory O
of O
his O
childhood O
life O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

Which O
child O
is O
you O
. O

Is O
this O
child O
you O
, O
or O
is O
that O
child O
you O
? O

Actually O
we O
should O
be O
accurate O
; O
this O
child O
's O
experiences O
, O

So O
this O
child O
, O

Um O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
because O
once O
, O
I O

My O
father O
was O
denounced O
, O
and O
then O
the O
rebels O
took O
us O
, O
took O
that O
child O
to O
see O
. O

Mm O
. O

They O
denounced O
my O
father O
, O
so O
I O
was O
very O
indignant O
, O

They O
let O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
expose O
my O
father O
, O

Mm O
. O

Then O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
after O
I O
took O
a O
kitchen O
knife O
and O
ran O
over O
to O
their O
home O
, O
that O
research O
institute O
, O
the O
doorway O
and O
vowed O
that O
I O
'd O
hack O
the O
guy O
up O
. O

A O
kitchen O
knife O
; O
a O
knife O
from O
your O
kitchen O
at O
home O
. O

Oh O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
a O
knife O
from O
my O
kitchen O
at O
home O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
standing O
there O
, O
lots O
of O
people O
surrounding O
me O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
you O
ca O
n't O
just O
hack O
people O
up O
. O

But O
I O
had O
already O
said O
it O
. O

What O
did O
you O
say O
? O

said O
I O
have O
to O
hack O
him O
, O
have O
to O
hack O
, O
so O
it O
was O
more O
or O
less O
like O
this O
child O
. O

But O
, O
those O
adults O
standing O
around O
reasoned O
with O
me O
, O
said O
look O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
this O
. O

If O
you O
do O
this O
, O
you O
'll O
stir O
up O
more O
trouble O
, O
and O
then O
wo O
n't O
your O
dad O
be O
even O
worse O
off O
? O

In O
fact O
when O
they O
said O
that O
, O
my O
mind O
had O
already O
eased O
. O

I O
could O
not O
lose O
the O
face O
this O
way O
, O
, O
So O
then O
I O
ran O
over O
and O
took O
a O
whack O
at O
the O
door O
, O
to O
get O
an O
excuse O
for O
myself O
. O

Was O
it O
all O
ruined O
? O
The O
door O
-- O

I O
slashed O
it O
twice O
. O

Um O
, O
was O
n't O
there O
any O
consequence O
? O

Mm O
, O
there O
was O
no O
consequence O
, O
, O
I O
just O
let O
the O
adults O
reason O
with O
me O
. O

Mm O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
memory O
from O
your O
childhood O
years O
. O

It O
, O
had O
a O
great O
influence O
on O
me O
. O

Including O
that O
village O
, O
that O
environment O
, O
it O
's O
all O
very O
familiar O
to O
you O
. O

More O
or O
less O
, O
very O
close O
to O
me O
, O
this O
is O
a O
novel O
of O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
the O
reason O
I O
like O
it O
is O
because O
, O
um O
, O
it O
brings O
up O
lots O
of O
that O
kind O
of O
childhood O
memories O
. O

Mm O
, O
you O
spent O
a O
large O
part O
of O
your O
childhood O
in O
Beijing B-GPE
. O

What O
year O
was O
it O
that O
you O
moved O
to O
Shanghai B-GPE
? O

How O
old O
were O
you O
at O
that O
time O
? O

, O
In O
'69 B-DATE
I O
was O
11 B-DATE
years I-DATE
old O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
well O
. O

In O
'69 B-DATE
at O
the O
age O
of O
11 B-DATE
you O
went O
from O
Beijing B-GPE
to O
Shanghai B-GPE
. O

Mm O
, O
your O
living O
environment O
changed O
, O
but O
perhaps O
that O
mischievousness O
had O
n't O
completely O
passed O
. O

Mm O
, O
as O
he O
puts O
it O
, O
looking O
at O
it O
now O
, O
some O
of O
the O
memories O
can O
be O
very O
painful O
, O
but O
it O
was O
pretty O
happy O
days O
. O

I O
went O
there O
every O
day O
and O
then O
they O
suspended O
classes O
, O
, O
so O
I O
could O
n't O
go O
to O
school O
, O
could O
n't O
go O
to O
class O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
, O
later O
I O
remember O
there O
was O
-- O
Mm O
. O
A O
guy O
in O
the O
engineering O
team O
, O
and O
he O
brought O
Quotations B-WORK_OF_ART
from I-WORK_OF_ART
Chairman I-WORK_OF_ART
Mao I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
said O
to O
me O
, O
He O
said O
, O
now O
take O
this O
, O
now O
take O
these O
Quotations B-WORK_OF_ART
from I-WORK_OF_ART
Chairman I-WORK_OF_ART
Mao I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
teach O
yourselves O
, O
and O
in O
the O
future O
you O
'll O
take O
up O
arms O
and O
teach O
yourselves O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
very O
happy O
, O
very O
excited O
, O
because O
they O
were O
bringing O
back O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
, O
why O
were O
you O
feeling O
so O
depressed O
? O

Right O
, O
but O
the O
problem O
-- O

Because O
, O
I O
had O
never O
studied O
well O
, O



In O
1966 B-DATE

day O
I O
went O
there O
, O
and O
the O
classes O
were O
suspended O
, O
, O
so O
they O
did O
n't O
let O
me O
go O
to O
school O
, O
did O
n't O
let O
me O
go O
to O
class O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
, O
afterward O
, O
I O
remember O
there O
was O
Mm O
. O
A O
guy O
in O
the O
engineering O
team O
, O
and O
he O
brought O
Quotations B-WORK_OF_ART
from I-WORK_OF_ART
Chairman I-WORK_OF_ART
Mao I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
said O
to O
me O
, O
He O
said O
, O
now O
take O
this O
, O
now O
take O
these O
Quotations B-WORK_OF_ART
from I-WORK_OF_ART
Chairman I-WORK_OF_ART
Mao I-WORK_OF_ART
and O
teach O
yourselves O
, O
and O
in O
the O
future O
you O
'll O
take O
up O
arms O
and O
teach O
yourselves O
. O

Lots O
of O
fun O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
I O
was O
with O
this O
group O
of O
kids O
all O
together O
, O
and O
everybody O
copied O
everybody O
else O
and O
it O
was O
even O
harder O
to O
study O
. O

In O
fact O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
we O
did O
n't O
study O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
, O

This O
class O
really O
helped O
me O
a O
lot O
, O
, O
sometimes O
in O
my O
life O
I O
think O
about O
this O
, O

Mm O
. O

That O
period O
was O
both O
a O
happy O
and O
a O
fun O
time O
. O

Because O
I O
was O
a O
good O
egg O
. O

In O
this O
I O
go O
against O
the O
grain O
. O

Um O
, O
the O
thing O
is O
, O
, O
they O
're O
all O
the O
same O
. O

If O
you O
're O
bad O
, O
you O
do O
what O
you O
want O
, O
and O
so O
, O
you O
're O
honest O
and O
so O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
be O
free O
. O

Plus O
when O
you O
yourself O
have O
already O
decided O
that O
you O
're O
a O
bad O
kid O
, O
then O
, O
you O
achieve O
a O
kind O
of O
liberation O
, O
and O
you O
're O
completely O
liberated O
and O
free O
. O

I O
think O
that O
-- O

Um O
, O
of O
course O
today B-DATE
we O
say O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
um O
, O
in O
that O
class O
of O
ours O
, O
they O
were O
n't O
all O
necessarily O
bad O
kids O
. O

Mm O
. O

They O
just O
were O
n't O
like O
normal O
kids O
. O

, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
brotherhood O
. O

Ah O
, O
and O
we O
did O
some O
things O
that O
were O
out O
of O
bounds O
. O

Mm O
, O
we O
helped O
each O
other O
. O

Very O
sincere O
, O
very O
sincere O
and O
good O
. O



When O
he O
was O
in O
that O
class O
, O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
received O
patient O
teaching O
every O
day O
. O

At O
that O
time O
he O
encountered O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
love O
of O
his O
life O
that O
still O
remains O
fresh O
in O
his O
memory O
. O

This O
girl O
became O
the O
only O
light O
in O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
's I-PERSON
dark O
life O
for O
several B-DATE
years I-DATE
. O

In O
those O
days O
if O
a O
middle O
school O
student O
liked O
a O
fellow O
- O
student O
, O
how O
did O
he O
go O
about O
expressing O
that O
? O

Um O
. O

When O
I O
was O
a O
school O
kid O
, O
for O
example O
, O
Um O
, O
that O
girl O
, O
who O
ran O
the O
kitchen O
and O
was O
one O
of O
the O
better O
students O
in O
our O
class O
, O
I O
liked O
her O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
always O
felt O
, O
um O
, O
she O
can O
, O
give O
you O
more O
on O
your O
plate O
, O
put O
more O
things O
on O
your O
plate O
for O
you O
to O
eat O
. O

And O
then O
the O
most O
obvious O
way O
was O
um O
, O
to O
go O
see O
a O
movie O
together O
. O

Mm O
. O

It O
was O
, O

So O
already O
you O
could O
-- O
Go O
see O
a O
movie O
; O
I O
thought O
, O

That O
was O
it O
, O
that O
was O
it O
. O

You O
just O
want O
to O
go O
see O
the O
movie O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
worry O
about O
holding O
hands O
or O
not O
, O
um O
, O
and O
that O
was O
great O
, O
-- O

So O
you O
went O
to O
the O
movies O
with O
this O
girl O
? O

Yes O
. O

Do O
you O
still O
remember O
what O
movies O
you O
saw O
? O

The B-WORK_OF_ART
Flower I-WORK_OF_ART
Girl I-WORK_OF_ART
. I-WORK_OF_ART

I O
still O
remember O
that O
now O
. O

Mm O
. O

She O
cried O
as O
hard O
as O
she O
could O
. O

So O
seeing O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Flower I-WORK_OF_ART
Girl I-WORK_OF_ART
was O
the O
equivalent O
of O
seeing O
Titanic B-WORK_OF_ART
now O
. O

Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
, O
a O
bit O
, O
a O
bit O
, O
yes O
, O
all O
was O
ready O
, O
no O
cry O
. O

Yes O
, O
crying O
her O
eyes O
out O
, O
a O
big O
film O
like O
that O
. O

At O
the O
time O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
n't O
cry O
. O

But O
the O
people O
all O
around O
were O
crying O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
cry O
it O
would O
look O
bad O
. O

So O
then O
you O
cried O
. O

So O
then O
I O
thought O
, O
I O
should O
let O
my O
emotions O
go O
. O

Um O
, O
how O
was O
the O
girl O
, O
was O
she O
very O
pretty O
? O

, O
now O
I O
remember O
that O
she O
was O
very O
pretty O
, O
mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

She O
was O
a O
very O
good O
student O
. O

Ha O
ha O
, O
this O
-- O

How O
was O
it O
she O
liked O
you O
? O

At O
that O
time O
we O
did O
n't O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
if O
two B-CARDINAL
people O
gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
and O
felt O
it O
was O
right O
, O
then O
, O

Gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
, O
while O
you O
were O
in O
the O
class O
you O
gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
. O

, O
so O
, O
when O
we O
were O
in O
class O
, O
for O
example O
you O
, O

I O
remember O
how O
it O
happened O
, O
yes O
. O

Um O
. O
When O
we O
went O
to O
class O
, O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
it O
was O
all O
very O
chaotic O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
then O
, O
we O
'd O
each O
pick O
up O
a O
piece O
of O
chalk O
and O
toss O
the O
chalk O
back O
and O
forth O
. O
And O
throw O
spitballs O
. O

I O
threw O
it O
at O
someone O
else O
but O
missed O
, O
and O
it O
hit O
her O
. O

The O
result O
was O
that O
she O
turned O
her O
head O
to O
look O
. O

And O
she O
looked O
at O
you O
angrily O
. O

I O
thought O
, O
uh-oh O
, O
the O
expression O
in O
her O
eyes O
was O
like O
she O
would O
forgive O
you O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
feeling O
. O

I O
thought O
wow O
, O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
feeling O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
's O
how O
it O
was O
, O
I O
should O
say O
. O

was O
like O
that O
? O

Mm O

about O
the O

a O
way O
to O

why O
were O
you O
feeling O
depressed O

Right O

but O
the O
problem O
was O
, O
, O
Because O
, O
I O
had O
never O
done O
well O
in O

. O

So O
right O
off O

-- O

Those O
kids O
who O
were O
younger O

, O
right O
off O
I O
was O
feeling O
down O
. O

Very O
clearly O
a O
-- O

If O

what O
kind O

I O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
nerve O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
try O
, O
so O
-- O

, O
the O
extraordinary O
thing O
was O
, O
at O
that O
time O
my O
mom O
was O
attending O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
she O
was O
an O
instructor O
there O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
I O
had O
n't O
thought O
, O
, O
that O
I O
would O
work O
in O
the O
movie O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
um O
, O
she O
wanted O
to O
send O
the O
recruitment O
announcement O
to O
a O
friend O
's O
house O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
then O
I O
-- O

One O
day O
she O
sent O
me O
to O
deliver O
it O
, O
and O
so O
I O
picked O
it O
up O
and O
read O
it O
, O
and O
once O
I O
read O
it O
, O
oh O
! O
The O
directing O
department O
of O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
inside O

no O
language O
exams O
, O
no O
math O
or O
physics O
or O
chemistry O
exams O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
wow O
! O
This O
is O
just O
the O
ticket O
. O

Let O
's O
run O
off O
to O
try O
and O
see O
. O

I O
thought O
you O
've O
loved O
movies O
ever O
since O
you O
were O
little O
, O
and O
then O
every O
day O
sitting O
in O
the O
movie O
theater O
you O
thought O
, O
I O
want O
to O
be O
a O
director O
. O

No O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
, O
no O
. O

It O
was O
just O
because O
there O
was O
no O
English B-LANGUAGE
exam O
, O
no O
exams O
in O
math O
or O
physics O
or O
chemistry O
. O

Right O
, O
it O
was O
very O
simple O
. O

Mm O
. O

One O
more O
thing O
, O
because O
in O
'78 B-DATE
, O
the B-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
was O
recruiting O
students O
in O
Shanghai B-GPE
-- O

Right O
. O

So O
, O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
went O
to O
take O
the O
exams O
for O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
pass O
the O
exams O
. O

His O
mother O
, O
An B-PERSON
Qi I-PERSON
, O
had O
never O
thought O
that O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
would O
sign O
up O
to O
take O
the O
exam O
for O
her O
work O
unit O
, O
the B-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Institute I-ORG
. O

But O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
in O
fact O
failed O
when O
he O
took O
the O
reinstated O
exam O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
time O
he O
had O
taken O
the O
exam O
, O
it O
left O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
even O
more O
convinced O
that O
movies O
were O
something O
he O
could O
do O
. O

The B-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O

old O
Ye B-PERSON

for O
the O
actors O
training O
class O
at O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio I-ORG
. O

Being O
an O
actor O
was O
not O
his O
goal O
; O
he O
hoped O
rather O
to O
get O
into O
the O
directing O
profession O
. O

At O
that O
time O
you O
especially O
admired O
directors O
, O
right O
? O

Mm O
, O
because O
after O
I O
got O
to O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio I-ORG
, O
um O
, O
I O
discovered O
I O
had O
the O
shakes O
when O
I O
got O
on O
stage O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O
Now O
, O
here O
chatting O
with O
you O
, O
I O
feel O
, O
um O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
. O

Even O
today B-DATE
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
lens O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
nervous O
wreck O
. O

Mm O
, O
very O
tense O
. O

Did O
you O
act O
then O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
every O
day O
we O
had O
to O
, O
um O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
just O
recitation O
, O
so O
, O
doing O
sketches O
, O
this O
and O
that O
. O

I O
thought O
, O
this O
is O
definitely O
not O
working O
. O

Just O
getting O
on O
stage O
gave O
you O
the O
shakes O
. O

Then O
, O
, O
no O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
my O
thing O
, O
this O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
find O
out O
why O
, O
and O
besides O
in O
those O
days O
, O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
in O
'80 B-DATE
that O
I O
went O
to O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio I-ORG
, O

Mm O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
it O
was O
, O
always O
that O
kind O
of O
pompous O
stuff O
, O
or O
, O
that O
milquetoast O
kind O
of O
young O
male O
character O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
not O
that O
kind O
of O
person O
, O
so O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
my O
bearings O
. O

So O
then O
at O
the O
same O
time O
when O
I O
saw O
that B-PERSON
Teng I-PERSON
Wenji I-PERSON
, O
he O
was O
probably O
thirty B-DATE
- I-DATE
some I-DATE
years I-DATE
old O
, O
he O
was O
the O
previous O
generation O
to O
us O
, O
very O
stubborn O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
projecting O
force O
of O
his O
, O
I O
thought O
wow O
, O
, O
that O
's O
really O
good O
. O

He O
could O
really O
project O
. O

Because O
ultimately O
, O
there O
, O
I O
gradually O
realized O
this O
. O

Mm O
. O

And O
I O
would O
be O
in O
the O
audience O
and O
see O
him O
directing O
on O
site O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
I O
could O
see O
how O
they O
worked O
. O

In O
fact O
in O
the O
beginning O
the O
attraction O
to O
movies O
was O
all O
these O
things O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
really O
a O
bunch O
of O
fluff O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
that O
's O
really O
fun O
, O
that O
's O
really O
interesting O
. O

I O
thought O
who O
was O
stubborn O
, O
then O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
that O
kind O
of O
person O
, O
but O
that O
did O
n't O
mean O
I O
knew O
anything O
about O
that O
profession O
. O



So O
no O
one O
ever O
came O
looking O
for O
you O
to O
do O
a O
play O
? O

At O
that O
time O
-- O

Mm O
, O
no O
one O
ever O
came O
looking O
-- O
. O

They O
looked O
, O
but O
it O
was O
always O
just O
for O
an O
extra O
. O

, O
you O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
any O
lines O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
Xi'an B-EVENT
Incident I-EVENT
thing O
, O
I O
played O
an O
extra O
once O
. O

There O
was O
a O
guy O
playing O
Zhang B-PERSON
Xueliang I-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
played O
his O
secretary O
going O
in O
to O
report O
to O
him O
, O
and O
I O
did O
it O
a O
few O
times O
but O
I O
was O
always O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
. O

What O
were O
your O
lines O
supposed O
to O
be O
? O

It O
was O
" O
reporting O
, O
a O
telegram O
" O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

So O
you O
-- O

So O
I O
had O
never O
served O
as O
a O
soldier O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
pose O
, O
it O
was O
really O
awful O
. O

So O
after O
I O
gave O
that O
up O
, O
no O
, O
it O
was O
not O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

So O

old O
director O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
Yin I-PERSON

many O
takes O

? O

Oh O

like O

plus I-CARDINAL
times O
. O

It O
was O
too O
, O
I O
'd O
walk O
badly O
and O
turn O
like O
that O
. O

, O
I O
attended O
that O
class O
for O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
year I-DATE
, O
um O

Um O

I O
could O
n't O
move O

When O

my O
leg O
went O
numb O

then O
my O
hand O
went O
numb O

it O
goes O
from O
the O
nerve O
endings O
to O
the O
flesh O

At O

Getting O

if O
I O
looked O

the O
story O
and O
the O
style O

was O
written O

made O
a O
profound O
impression O
on O

He O
sighed O
, O
this O
expresses O
what O
our O

really O
wants O
to O
express O

there O
you O
know O

and O
%uh O
I O
'm O
on O
a O
pretty O
good O
project O
. O

Right O
. O

a O
long O
term O
%uh O
next O
generation O
%uh O
fighter O
plane O
. O

Really O
? O

So O
that O
's O
%uh O
kind O
of O
good O
experience O
I O
guess O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
%uh O
Westinghouse B-ORG
supposedly O
is O
making O
a O
bid O
to O
buy O
the O
%uh O
C O
B O
S O
broadcasting O
network O
. O

I O
thought O
they O
bought O
them O
already O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
takes O
months O
to O
close O
a O
deal O

so O
there O
's O
-- O
%ah O
. O
-- O
lots O
of O
speculation O
-- O
Right O
. O
-- O
that O
they O
'll O
have O
to O
sell O
the O
%uh O
electronics O
division O
in O
order O
to O
do O
that O
. O

and O
what O
would O
happen O
with O
you O
? O

I O
guess O
we O
'd O
be O
sold O
to O
another O
company O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
too O
concerned O
about O
it O
though O

but O
it O
's O
a O
possibility O
. O

But O
you O
have O
a O
senior O
position O
there O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
suppose O
so O
. O

But O
, O
you O
know O
. O
They O
do O
n't O
really O
think O
of O
it O
that O
way O

they O
just O
look O
at O
the O
numbers O
how O
many O
people O
they O
want O
and O
how O
many O
people O
they O
have O
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
business O
. O

Right O
. O

they O
just O
get O
rid O
of O
what O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%uh O
that O
's O
still O
going O
pretty O
well O
. O

%huh O

nothing O
really O
new O
with O
the O
house O
or O
anything O

We O
've O
had O
some O
interesting O
incidents O
with O
wasps O
that O
have O
%uh O
been O
invading O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

they O
built O
a O
nest O
in O
my O
rafters O
of O
my O
house O
and O
busted O
through O
. O

But O
I O
told O
you O
about O
that O
, O
I O
think O
. O

I O
got O
a O
in O
the O
mail O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
that O

Well O
I O
wanted O
to O
ask O
you O
what O
's O
with O
the O
school O
? O

The O
schools O
are O
extremely O
expensive O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
broke O
basically O
doing O
that O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
%uh O
handle O
that O
. O

But O
how O
come O
they O
do O
n't O
help O
you O
? O

It O
does O
n't O
make O
a O
difference O
. O

you O
're O
still O
going O
to O
go O
broke O
whether O
they O
help O
you O
or O
not O
. O

They O
're O
not O
going O
to O
let O
you O
run O
a O
profit O
when O
you O
're O
on O
scholarship O
. O

if O

two B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars I-MONEY

the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year I-DATE
they O
're O
not O
going O
to O
say O
oh O

guess O
you O
can O
have O
that O
. O

They O
're O
going O
to O
make O
you O
pay O

%ah O
a O
resume O

okay O

. O

And O
I O
'll O
just O
pass O
it O
on O
just O
to O
get O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
much O
you O
may O
be O
able O
to O
make O
. O

That O
sounds O
okay O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
excellent O
idea O
. O

%um O
, O
I O
know O
your O
wife O
does O
n't O
believe O
me O

but O
%uh O
we O
think O
about O
you O
guys O
like O
continuously O
. O

and O
it O
really O
%uh O
makes O
my O
heart O
ache O
. O

But O
%uh O




yeah O

until O
like O
you O
find O
something O
that O
is O
n't O
stressful O
and O
not O
boring O
. O

yeah O

that O
's O
the O
main O
two B-CARDINAL
combinations O
right O
? O

yeah O
. O

Not O
stressful O
and O
not O
boring O

yeah O
. O

Well O
it O
's O
like O
I O
have O
no O
problems O
with O
secretarial O
work O

okay O
that O
's O
what O
fitted O
in O
to O
that O
category O
because O
if O
you O
are O
a O
busy O
enough O
secretary O
you O
know O
%eh O
%mm O
. O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
bored O
because O
you O
are O
always O
doing O
something O
different O

and O
if O
your O
employer O
is O
a O
relatively O
decent O
human O
being O
you O
know O
two B-CARDINAL
if's O
there O

mhm O
. O

but O
you O
get O
no O
respect O

I O
mean O
oh O
you O
're O
a O
secretary O

and O
the O
pay O
is O
pretty O
crummy O

well O
it O
's O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
as O
what O
I O
'm O
getting O
you O
know O
%um O
depending O
upon O
where O
you O
work O
and O
all O

but O
you O
know O
it O
's O
like O
that O
's O
no O
answer O
either O

so O
I O
've O
just O
been O
toying O
with O
this O
idea O
of O
going O
back O
to O
school O
and O
getting O
a O
computer O
science O
degree O
so O
I O
can O
always O
be O
gainfully O
employed O
. O

But O
anyway O
, O

and O
you O
can O
think O
about O
that O
pregnancy O
thing O

oh O
yeah O

that O
pregnancy O
thing O

yeah O

that O

do O
the O

Maybe O
there O
's O
your O
hormones O
calling O
. O

yeah O

well O
no O

the O
funny O
thing O
is O
it O
's O
like O
ten O
years O
ago O
I O
would O
've O
said O
oh O
yeah O
that O
was O
what O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
having O
a O
baby O
you O
know O

but O
like O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
we O
're O
going O
to O
do O
it O
because O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
%uh O
%eh O
you O
know O
in B-DATE
the I-DATE
next I-DATE
year I-DATE
or O
two B-CARDINAL
we O
'd O
regret O
it O
you O
know O

we O
figure O
it O
's O
something O
we O
'd O
want O
to O
do O

it O
's O
not O
like O
we O
're O
doing O
it O
because O
we O
have O
to O
do O
it O
or O
there O
's O
peer O
pressure O

or O
well O
a O
%mm O
little O
peer O
pressure O

oh O
no O
no O
no O

I O
know O
exactly O
where O
you O
're O
at O
because O
I O
think O
about O
that O
too O

I O
got O
about O
like O
six B-CARDINAL
or O
seven B-DATE
years I-DATE

I O
figure O
my O
body O
is O
a O
very O
slow O
%um O
yeah O
**maturer** O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

like O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
my O
period O
until O
I O
was O
sixteen B-DATE

I O
mean O
I O
look O
like O
about O
%uh O
%uh O
at O
least O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE
younger O
than O
I O
actually O
am O

-- O
and O
I O
'm O
just O
starting O
to O
get O
my O
period O
actually O
now O
-- O
yeah O
yeah O
as O
an O
adult O
. O

So O
I O
kind O
of O
figure O
well O
I O
'm O
probably O
good O
until O
at O
least O
some O
time O
in O
the B-DATE
early I-DATE
forties I-DATE

and O
I O
could O
probably O
go O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
that O

I O
know O
there O
's O
a O
risk O
and O
all O
that O
bullshit O

yeah O
. O

but O
%um O
yeah O
I O
think O
about O
that O
too O
because O
it O
's O
like O
I O
mean O
I O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
way O
things O
are O
going O
in O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
responsibility O
. O

I O
know O

well O
I O
mean O
that O
's O
the O
thing O

kids O
are O
cute O
and O
all O
that O

and O
we O
%mm O
slept O
until O
noon B-TIME

we O
got O
up O
about B-TIME
ten I-TIME
and O
was O
like O

played O
with O
the O
cats O

okay O
I O
mean O

're O
talking O
total O
slackers O

%mm O

and O
I O
thought O
gee O

know O
if O
we O
had O
a O
kid O
we O
could O
n't O
do O
this O
you O
know O

and O

%mm O

No O

you O
got O
to O
be O
focused O
on O
that O

and O
I O
mean O
there O
's O

lots O
of O
other O
things O
that O

I O
mean O
as O
far O

Laura B-PERSON

%uh O
because O

so O
she O
sent O
me O
a O
letter O
back O
saying O
you O

remember O
how O
crowded O
the O
transportation O

%uh O
what O
else O

%mm O
. O
how O
expensive O
everything O
is O

and O
%uh O
you O
know O
I O
remember O
those O
things O
of O
course O
you O
know O
-- O

And O
work O
you O
know O
possibilities O
were O
a O
lot O
more O
limited O

True O
. O

and O
the O
language O
you O
know O
yeah O
. O
constantly O
like O
kind O
of O

like O
I O
mean O
those O
could O
be O
considered O
positive O
things O
as O
well O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
mind O
as O
well O
think O
of O
them O
in O
a O
negative O
vie- O
rather O
than O

mhm O
sure O

They O
just O
like O
worrying O
over O
them O
. O

Well O
you O
know O
and O
that O
's O
why O
it O
helps O
to O
have O
kind O
of O
a O
glimpse O
into O
the O
future O
right O
? O

And O
that O
's O
how O
we O
got O
to O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
Spain B-GPE
in O
the O
first B-ORDINAL
place O
is O
we O
said O
we O
wanted O
to O
live O
abroad O
and O
we O
would O
try O
to O
do O
it O
you O
know O
as O
teachers O

and O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
way O
because O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
we O
had O
this O
idea O
of O

and O
I O
really O
feel O
that O
that O
's O
important O

and O
so O
what O
I O
'm O
having O
an O
idea O
of O
now O
is O

okay O
you O
know O
Emory B-PERSON
works O
on O
his O
doctorate O

it O
takes O
about O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
six B-DATE
years I-DATE

we O
have O
the O
kid O
probably O

he O
gets O
a O
research O
position O
somewhere O
in O
France B-GPE
or O
in O
Spain B-GPE
%um O

and O
then O
we O
move O
over O
there O

and O
you O
know O
I O
take O
care O
of O
the O
kid O
and O
do O
some O
you O
know O
little O
day O
labor O
whatever O
you O
know O

we O
'll O
see O

%mm O
. O

%um O
and O
we O
have O
relatively O
mellow O
life O
for O
who O
knows O
five B-CARDINAL
or O
ten B-DATE
years I-DATE

and O
then O
we O
take O
it O
from O
there O
. O

yeah O

because O
even O
like O
you O
know O
I O
mean O
all O
that O
stuff O
right O
is O
all O
so O
subject O
to O
whatever O
change O
in O
the O
weather O
that O
happens O
to O
be O
right O
? O

mhm O
. O

oh O
I O
know O

I O
know O

and O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
what O
I O
think O
because O
I O
get O
the O
same O
as O
you O

like O
some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
kind O
of O
like O
you O
know O
what O
the O
hell O
am O
I O
doing O
not O
with O
my O
life O
but O
ge- O

but O
I O
mean O
just O
like O
where O
do O
I O
get O
the O
animal O
just O
you O
know O
to O
do O
anything O
you O
know O

I O
just O
lay O
in O
bed O
and O
dream O
for O
the O
whole O
day O
easily O

yeah O

I O
know O
. O

Well O
I O
know O

I O
know O
what O
you O
're O
saying O

I O
feel O
there O
's O
sort O
of O
a O
line O
to O
cross O
too O
between O
really O
planning O
it O
out O
and O
worry O
and O
stressing O
over O
it O
because O
for O
a O
while O
a O
couple O
months O
back O
there O
I O
was O
thinking O
in O
terms O
of O
oh O
gosh O
you O
know O
can O
we O
ever O
afford O
a O
house O

%mm O
. O

and O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
sort O
of O
looked O
at O
it O
financially O
and O
said O
is O
this O
what O
we O
really O
want O
to O
be O
worrying O
about O
right O
now O

and O
you O
know O
I O
realize O
no O

yeah O
absolutely O
. O

and O
so O
you O
know O
you O
can O
sort O
of O
focus O
too O
much O
on O
the O
future O

or O
I O
know O
I O
have O
this O
tendency O
to O
do O
that O
. O

And O
miss O
the O
present O
completely O

I O
mean O
miss O
like O
you O
know O
the O
smell O
of O

goddamn O
onions O
frying O
in O

I O
'm O
concerned O

's O
as O
intense O
as O
the O
one O
that O
you O
are O
experiencing O
at O
that O
moment O
you O
know O

you O
can O
think O
about O
what O
something O
might O
be O
like O
or O
reminisce O
about O
the O
past O

but O
like O
when O
you O
're O
there O
in O
that O
moment O

this O
point O

they O
tell O
us O
I O
think O
Europe B-GPE

it O
breaks O
my O
heart O
when O

following O
that O

they O
think O
everything O

so O
wonderful O

if O
there O
's O
some O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
know O

they O
take O
the O
good O
and O
the O
bad O
all O
the O

and O
that O
's O
t- O

yeah O

oh O
it O
's O
pitiful O

that O
makes O
me O
very O
very O
sad O

you O
know O
oh O
it O
's O
%eh O

very O

Mitnics O
the O
Mitnics O

Well O
what O
about O
the O
Allens B-PERSON

what O
was O
their O
connection O
to O
that O

Well O
so O
originally O
he O
had O
come O
back O
from O
the O
army O

they O
got O
married O

he O
graduated O
Cornell B-ORG
agricultural O

had O
to O
be O
a O
farmer O

so O
about O
maybe O
two B-CARDINAL
three B-DATE
years I-DATE
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
years O
they O
had O
a O
dairy O
farm O

and O
you O
know O
how O
rough O

they O
were O
slaves O

they O
could O
n't O
go O
anywhere O
do O
anything O

yeah O

they O
had O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
farm O
because O
it O
's O
a O
small O
you O
know O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
of O
this O

yeah O

but O
that O
's O
a O
lot O
like O
you O

you O
're O
much O
younger O
than O
me O

I O
was O
born O
in O
fifty B-CARDINAL

oh O
so O
you O
're O
much O

I O
'm O
born O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
thirty I-DATE
nine I-DATE

so O
you O
're O

in O
nineteen B-DATE
fifty I-DATE

yeah O

yeah O

there O
's O
a O
difference O

yeah O

Yes O

so O
they O
left O
maybe O
before O
you O
were O
born O

yes O

yeah O

could O
b- O

or O
just O
about O
the O
time O
you O
were O
born O
they O
left O
Hudson B-GPE

yeah O

not O
the- O

So O
then O
they O
went O
to O
Middletow- O

%um O
then O
he O
came O
%um O
for O
the O
girls O

n't O
be O
managed O

he O
became O

he O
had O
been O
a O
captain O
in O
the O
army O
over O
difficult O
troops O
yeah O
So O
that O
he O
got O
into O
the O
correctional O
facility O
business O

I O
mean O
he O
got O
a O

They O
started O
asking O
me O
when O
I O
was O
on O

already O
. O

And O
so O
I O
'm O
sort O
of O

it O
's O
easier O
to O
think O
about O
doing O
it O
when O
you O
're O
on O
vacation O
yeah O
. O
than O
if O

this O
idea O
%eh O
when O
you O
're O
at O
work O
and O
say O
, O
oh O
I O
ca O
n't O
go O
in O
four B-DATE
weeks I-DATE

How O
could O
I O
possibly O
just O
do O
that O
? O

I O
know O
the O
feeling O
. O

I O
m- O

But O
once O
you O
're O
in O
vacation O
mode O
, O
it O
's O
sort O
of O
like O

why O
should O
n't O
I O
? O

I O
have O
the O
vacation O
, O

it O
's O
just O
you O
know O
, O
the O
time O
, O
and O
the O
money O
, O

and O

his O

No O

So O
he O
mentioned O
that O
he O
was O
looking O
for O
his O
tuxedo O
. O

And O
I O
said O
you O
're O
going O
to O
get O
married O
in O
a O
tuxedo O
? O

He O
said O

no O
. O

That O
evening O
. O

I O
've O
never O

's O
okay O
. O

actually O
met O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States I-GPE

I O
think O
the B-ORG
University I-ORG
&of I-ORG
Virginia I-ORG
, O
where O
he O
got O
his O
doctorate O
? O

Or O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
not O
Virginia B-GPE
, O

but O
it O
's O
somewhere O
over O
there O
. O

mhm O
. O

Something O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

so O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
're O
not O
really O
young O
. O

So O
I O
s- O
, O

their O
friends O
I O
presume O
are O
in O
the O
same O
age O
. O

I O
think O
there O
'll O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
family O
friends O
. O

I O
have O
a O
f- O

okay O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
'm O
sure O
. O

weddings O
are O
always O
family O
. O

and O
the O
way O
he O
was O
talking O
, O
it O
sounds O
like O
his O
wife O
's O
family O
is O
well O
- O
to O
- O
do O
or O
something O
. O

so O

yeah O

well O
if O
it O
, O
ye- O

Interesting O
people O
. O

If O
they O
're O
having O
a O
wedding O
with O
Abendgarderobe O
then O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
pretty O

that O
's O
what O
I O
thought O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
thought O
. O

Up O
upscale O
. O

And O
that O
. O

So O
think O
about O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O
I O
'll O
let O
you O
think O
about O
that O
, O

and O
you O
can O
write O
me O
a O
note O
or O
give O
me O
a O
call O
. O

Because O
I O
know O
some O
people O
really O
hate O
weddings O
. O

But O
you O
're O
afraid O
to O
say O
no O
, O

or O
you O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

But O
it O
's O
the B-DATE
twelfth I-DATE
. O

And O
otherwise O
, O
what O
I O
'd O

to O
do O
is O
stay O

Like O
we O
could O
see O
each O
other O
. O

And O
then O
I O
'll O
go O
Monday B-DATE
-- O
down O
to O
Bonn B-GPE
, O
or O
wherever O
those O

I O
have O
n't O

like B-DATE
three I-DATE
or I-DATE
four I-DATE
years I-DATE

Bad B-GPE
Munstereifel I-GPE

live O
in O
-- O
%um O
, O
Bad B-GPE

. O

yeah O
, O

just O
a O
little O
bit O

And O
then O
my O
cousin O
, O

live O
in O
Bonn B-GPE

so O
I O
'll O
get O
to O
see O
her O
. O

And O
then O
I O
'll O
zip O
off O
to O
Berlin B-GPE
Right O
. O
mhm O
mhm O
go O

n't O
tell O
the O

n't O
visit O

n't O
want O
to O
spend O
time O
visiting O
these O
other O
relatives O
in O
Bonn B-GPE
. O

you O
're O
so O
diplomatic O
about O
all O
of O
that O
, O
you O
know O

Well O
I O
mean O
if O
I O
was O
visiting O
you O
, O
it O
would O
be O
very O
hard O
not O
to O
visit O
them O
. O

but O
n- O

But O
the O
year O
before O
I O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
, O
%uh O
, O
tell O
on O
you O
, O
you O
know O
. O

I O
know O
you O
would O
n't O
tell O
. O

But O
the O
year O
before O
I O
did O
it O
. O

But O
that O
's O
because O
of O
we O
just O
stopped O
on O
the O
train O
and O
I O
had O
, O
you O
know O
, O
two B-TIME
hours I-TIME
. O

And O
we O
had O
our O
wild O
lunch O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
on O
again O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O

We O
, O
%uh O
, O
commiserated O
. O

Yes O
. O

That O
sounds O
like O
you O
have O
you O
know O
its O
positive O
end O
result O
, O
which O
is O
good O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
it O
's O
a O
change O
, O

that O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

It O
's O
a O
change O
. O

And O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
, O
obviously O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
, O

%eh O
but O
you O
know O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
. O

I O
always O
have O
this O
feeling O
I O
'm O
just O
so O
terribly O
slow O
. O

I O
have O
this O
feeling O
I O
should O
always O
be O
doing O
these O
things O
much O
faster O
than O
I O
get O
them O
done O
. O

Well O
, O
so O
what O
if O
you O
're O
slow O
? O

You O
know O
, O
look O
at O
it O
the O
other O
way O
. O

yeah O

but O
I O
always O
keep O
%eh O
that O
I O
'm O
spending O
too O
much O
time O
, O
that O
I O
should O
be O
doing O
other O
things O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
just O
had O
this O
talk O
about O
somebody O
who O
was O
you O
know O
, O
confirming O
, O
you O
know O

and O
I O
know O
I O
'm O
too O
self O
critical O
. O

So O
. O
It O
's O
not O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Because O
I O
was O
complaining O
to O
them O
about O
my O
mother O

and O
they O
are O
this O
theory O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
what O
people O
do O
is O
a O
reflection O
of O
you O
. O

%huh O
. O

Because O
this O
woman O
had O
such O
a O
that O
people O
react O
to O
you O
as O
a O
reflection O
of O
you O
. O

And O
what O
I O
had O
mentioned O
about O
my O
mother O
bugging O
me O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
every O
time O
I O
see O
her O
or O
we O
even O
talk O
, O
she O
has O
to O
comment O
about O
my O
clothes O
, O
or O
what O
I O
'm O
wearing O
. O

and O
I O
was O
talking O
to O
this O
woman O
because O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
such O
a O
good O
relationship O
with O
her O
mother O
. O

Like O
her O
mother O
treated O
her O
like O
a O
human O
being O
and O
not O
a O
kid O
. O

%hm O
yeah O

and O
so O
she O
said O
you O
know O
and O
she O
's O
just O
a O
reflection O
. O

You O
know O
your O
mother O
's O
being O
critical O
you O
know O
. O

Be O
you O
see O
that O
because O
you O
're O
critical O
to O
yourself O
too O
much O

Or O
you O
're O
filtering O
the O
information O
you O
get O
from O
your O
mother O

yeah O

but O
this O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

I O
mean O
%uh O
she O
's O
never O
let O
up O
on O
that O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
crazy O
. O
You O
know O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
I O
mean O

and O
I O
think O
no O
not O
the O
last O
time O
the O
last O
time O
on O
the O
phone O
I O
bugged O
her O
about O
something O
else O
that O
I O
been O
trying O
to O
not O
take O
anymore O

but O
then O
she O
cries O

but O
that O
does O
n't O
work O
with O
me O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

That O
's O
good O
. O

Then O
she O
says O
I O
'm O
being O
mean O
. O

and O
I O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
's O
crying O
. O

I O
'm O
pretty O
tough O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

speaking O
of O
crying O
, O
I O
have O
a O
colleague O
. O
An O
American B-NORP
girl O
, O
a O
dancer O
. O
mhm O
at O
a O
school O
in O
Cologne B-GPE
mhm O
Who O
somehow O
or O
other O
has O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
me O
. O

mhm O

and O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
, O
going O
back O
to O
Duesseldorf B-GPE
she O
's O
all O
going O
crazy O
. O
%um O
and O
thinks O
%eh O

she O
's O
%eh O
concluded O
that O
I O
'm O
abandoning O
her O
. O

oho O

But O
it O
is O

Being O
stalked O
here O
? O

Pardon O
? O

In O
America B-GPE
, O
we O
would O
say O
are O
you O
being O
stalked O
? O




so O
he O
said O
to O
let O
your O
wife O
do O
it O
you O
know O

%uh O
right O

he O
says O
%uh O
you O
know O
no O
I O
'm O
going O
to O

%eh O
so O
now O
I O
'm O
at O
a O
point O
that O
it O
's O
very O
strange O

like O
I O
wo O
n't O
complain O
about O
anything O

or O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
anything O

and O
I O
ca O
n't O
ask O
him O
to O
come O
help O
me O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
when O
I O
forgot O
to O
take O
out O
something O
they O
put O
in O
the O
freezer O

So O
we O
'll O
see O
how O
it O
goes O

hopefully O

I O
mean O
they O
promise O
me O
you O
know O
everybody O
that O
they O
're O
going O
to O
help O
me O
and O
that O
whatever O
I O
say O

But O
you O
know O
everybody O
gives O
you O
%uh O
these O
%uh O
pro- O

yeah O

so O
you O
've O
already O
started O

Well O
I O
've O
started O
working O
with O
Du O

like O
I O
do O
n't O
cook O
anymore O

I O
have O
n't O
worked O
in O
the O
kitchen O
for O
a O
week O
already O

I O
've O
been O
just O
doing O
with O
him O
learning O
how O
to O
do O
the O
orders O
and O
meeting O
all O
the O
%um O
sales O
people O

and O
%um O
I O
've O
learned O
how O
to O
work O
the O
computer O
which O
is O
the O
bigges- O

I O
said O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
even O

really O

So O
I O
'm O
not O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
could O
do O
it O
yet O
by O
myself O

but O
he O
's O
showing O
me O
teaching O
me O

and O
I O
think O
like O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
week O
he O
'll O
be O
there O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
with O
me O

and O
then O
anoth- O

he O
%um O

Maybe O
here O
and O
there O

but O
he O
's O
really O
basically O

What O
is O
he O
going O
to O
do O

He O
's O
going O
to O
be O
a O
teacher O
for O
%um O
High O
school O
computers O

oh O
okay O

yeah O

so O
he O
's O
only O
teaching O
three B-DATE
days I-DATE
a O
week O

so O
he O
always O
says O
that O
on O
the O
other O
days O
if O
I O
need O
him O
he O
'll O
come O
in O

the O
truth O
is O
he O
's O
been O
teaching O
and O
very O
patient O
and O
very O
good O

and O
he O
also O
is O
great O
that O
he O
has O
written O
down O
everything O

I O
'm O
sure O
he O
's O
thrilled O
to O
get O
out O
of O
there O

Well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
%uh O

I O
mean O
now O
that O
I O
worked O
with O
him O
one O
to O
one O
He O
does O
do O
everything O
with O
his O
heart O

I O
mean O
he O
has O
a O
different O
head O
than O
everybody O
else O

like O
I O
know O
that O
he O
wants O
everything O
to O
be O
nice O
and O
to O
be O
good O
and O

but O
he O
's O
very O
separate O

and O
he O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
listen O
to O
other O
people O
's O
%um O
ideas O

but O
%um O
I O
'm O
sure O
financially O
he O
was O
probably O
great O
for O
the O
kibbutz O
because O
he O
was O
cheap O

yeah O

because O
he O
's O
also O

I O
'll O
tell O
you O

I O
worked O
with O
him O
this O
whole O
week O

he O
does O
n't O
eat O
a O
thing O
ever O

like O
all O
morning O
long O

so O
he O
does O
n't O
eat O

he O
does O
n't O
drink O
coffee O

I O
did O
n't O
see O
him O
drink O
anything O
water O
or O
anything O
else O

one O
day O
he O
said O
I O
better O
drink O
something O
I O
have O
a O
headache O
because O
it O
was O
really O
hot O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
know O
he O
does O
n't O
eat O
anything O

and O
then O
for O
lunch O
when O
we O
finally O
went O
to O
go O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
Also O
he O
eats O
like O
a O
little O
What O
we O
would O
eat O
maybe O
half O
for O
a O
meal O

and O
that O
's O
it O

so O
I O
can O
understand O
now O
why O
he O
thinks O
that O
because O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
big O
eyes O
you O
know O

right O

that O
's O
so O
funny O

but O
anyway O

no O

so O
he O
had O
agreed O
to O
do O
it O
for O
a B-DATE
year I-DATE

and O
his O
year O
is O
over O

I O

are O
you O
excited O
at O
all O
about O
it O

or O

well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O

until O
I O
made O
the O
decision O
I O
was O
scared O
and O
also O
utz O

I O
miss O
the O
cooking O
part O

You O
miss O
it O

that O
's O
funny O

I O

yeah O

yeah O

like O
this O
week O
even O
when O
they O
made O
the O
%um O
coleslaw O
you O
know O
& O
kept O
calling O
me O
to O
taste O
it O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
was O
the O
way O

and O
they O
're O
going O
to O
notice O
that O
the O
cooking O
is O
different O

Well O
that O
's O
what O
even O
**ruthie** O
says O
you O
know O

everyone O
thinks O
that O
the O
economie O
is O
so O
important O

but O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
that O
are O
very O
important O
of O
running O
the O
kitchen O

and O
we O
'll O
see O

%uh O
right O
now O
Ramon B-PERSON
%uh O



you O
know O
Cocoa B-PERSON
she O
got O
married O

She O
married O
that O
guy O

not O
the O
Israeli B-NORP
guy O
not O
the O
Sephardic B-NORP
guy O
but O
No O

're O
kidding O
that O
little O
feminine O
kind O
of O

reme- O

when O
I O

but O
%um O
it O
was O
over O
already O
around O
then O

but O
they O
were O
still O
friends O

and O
this O
guy O
was O
a O
here O
or O
something O
drawer O

I O
think O
his O
family O
is O
Romanian B-NORP
or O
something O

anyway O

yeah O

it O
was O
very O

allow O
that O

Well O
I O
guess O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
choice O

but O
the O
worst O
thing O
was O
originally O
when O
she O
came O
to O
her O
parents O
and O
she O

even O
they O

maybe O
they O
would O
've O
changed O

Natan B-PERSON

upset O
that O
the O

a O
nonreligious O
kibbutz O

gosh O

yeah O

So O
now O
they O
're O
living O
on O
his O
kibbutz O
%um O
because O
they O
allow O
like O
B'nai B-NORP
to O
live O
there O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
they O
can O
work O
outside O
yeah O
do O
whatever O
they O
want O
until O

do O
what O
they O
want O

do O
whatever O
they O

doing O

his O
parents O

was O
really O
weird O

like O
when O
she O

it O
was O
a O
little O
hard O
for O

not O
religious O
and O
everyone O

The O
Bible B-WORK_OF_ART
says O
: O
" O
If O
you O
have O
faith O
as O
a O
grain O
of O
mustard O
seed O
, O
you O
will O
say O
to O
this O
mountain O
, O
' O
Move O
hence O
to O
yonder O
place O
, O
' O
and O
it O
will O
move O
; O
and O
nothing O
will O
be O
impossible O
to O
you O
. O
" O

For O
small O
as O
the O
mustard O
seed O
is O
, O
it O
grows O
into O
a O
mighty O
, O
spreading O
tree O
. O

Applying O
these O
words O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE

they O
most O
aptly O
describe O
the O

are O
the O

seeds O
no O

yet O
they O
grow O
into O
huge O
trees O
up O
to O
60 B-QUANTITY
meters I-QUANTITY

The O
Taiwan B-GPE

witnessed O
Taiwan B-GPE

Largely O
due O

his O

Chinese B-NORP
archeology O
attained O
a O
sturdy O

enabled O
it O

emerge O

His O
research O
showed O
that O
the O

not O
occur O
exclusively O
in O
the O

overturned O

difference O
is O
that O

" O
and O
Taiwan B-GPE
has O
no O
need O

ahead O

once O

was O
able O

its O

Later O
, O
when O

trickling O
across O
to O
Taiwan B-GPE
, O
they O
mainly O
settled O
along O
rivers O
. O

Because O
Pali B-GPE
is O
relatively O
close O
to O
the O
mainland O
and O
sits O
at O
the O
mouth O

despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O

in O
1757 B-DATE
the O
Qing B-NORP

small O
number O

Thus O
began O
an O

out O

Once O

Pali B-GPE
increasingly O

to O
rely O
on O

But O
the O
hilly O

to O
strengthen O
friendships O
by O
building O
upon O
the O
existing O
foundation O
. O

Tien B-PERSON
stressed O
that O
the O
president O
would O
not O
sign O
any O
new O
foreign O
aid O
agreements O
. O

President O
Chen B-PERSON
received O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome O
in O
Nicaragua B-GPE
, O
but O
the O
local O
press O
still O
mentioned O
" O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
" O
in O
reporting O
on O
the O
visit O
. O

The O
ROC B-GPE
's O
ambassador O
to O
Nicaragua B-GPE
, O
Antonio B-PERSON
Tsai I-PERSON
, O
bluntly O
argued O
in O
a O
briefing O
with O
Chen B-PERSON
that O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
foreign O
assistance O
to O
Nicaragua B-GPE
was O
being O
misused O
. O

According O
to O
Tsai B-PERSON
, O
the O
assistance O
has O
been O
used O
to O
build O
a O
presidential O
palace O
and O
a O
new O
headquarters O
for O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs I-ORG
. O

Opposition O
politicians O
charge O
that O
the O
aid O
has O
done O
nothing O
for O
everyday O
people O
, O
and O
Western B-NORP
nations O
have O
also O
been O
critical O
. O

A O
second B-ORDINAL
problem O
connected O
with O
the O
trip O
was O
the O
question O
of O
who O
would O
act O
in O
the O
president O
's O
stead O
while O
he O
was O
out O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Concern O
over O
this O
issue O
prompted O
President O
Chen B-PERSON
to O
state O
before O
his O
departure O
that O
he O
would O
remain O
commander O
- O
in O
- O
chief O
of O
the O
military O
forces O
, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
maintain O
hot O
lines O
to O
every O
cabinet O
- O
level O
agency O
. O

The O
president O
said O
that O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
an O
acting O
president O
because O
he O
had O
taken O
painstaking O
precautions O
to O
ensure O
domestic O
political O
stability O
during O
his O
absence O
. O



So O
is O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
diplomacy O
a O
way O
of O
giving O
back O
to O
the O
international O
community O
? O

Or O
is O
it O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
? O

Ambassador O
- O
without O
- O
portfolio O
Lu B-PERSON
Yi I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
cheng I-PERSON
wrote O
an O
article O
in O
which O
he O
argued O
that O
foreign O
aid O
has O
always O
been O
universally O
recognized O
as O
a O
regular O
tool O
of O
diplomacy O
as O
well O
as O
a O
humanitarian O
necessity O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
Taiwan B-GPE
should O
have O
to O
steer O
clear O
of O
it O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
world O
's O
developed O
nations O
spend O
an O
average O
of O
0.24 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
of O
GNP O
on O
foreign O
aid O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
0.17 B-PERCENT
% I-PERCENT
in O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
case O
. O

In O
view O
of O
Taiwan B-GPE
's O
economic O
strength O
, O
argued O
Lu B-PERSON
, O
our O
foreign O
aid O
expenditures O
need O
not O
be O
reduced O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
they O
should O
even O
be O
raised O
somewhat O
. O

The O
ROC B-GPE
has O
been O
criticized O
a O
lot O
in O
recent O
years O
for O
pursuing O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
surprise O
when O
this O
issue O
cropped O
up O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
president O
's O
trip O
. O

The O
question O
of O
an O
acting O
president O
, O
however O
, O
has O
never O
before O
been O
a O
matter O
of O
concern O
. O

This O
situation O
is O
to O
some O
degree O
a O
reflection O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
public O
still O
has O
doubts O
about O
the O
new O
administration O
's O
ability O
to O
govern O
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
point O
that O
is O
worth O
keeping O
in O
mind O
. O

expressed	O

it	O
is	O
that	O

she	O
has	O
gotten	O
off	O

this	O
although	O
she	O
does	O

She	O
is	O
going	O

today	O

I	O
hope	O
that	O
she	O
will	O
help	O
her	O
with	O
her	O
diet	O
.	O

If	O
her	O
diet	O
does	O
get	O
better	O
,	O
maybe	O
we	O
can	O
wean	O
her	O
off	O
the	O
insulin	O
and	O
try	O
Micronase	O
.	O

I	O
explained	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
she	O
both	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
diet	O
and	O
lost	O
some	O

that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
her	O
off	O
the	O
insulin	O
.	O

This	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
something	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

Hopefully	O
the	O
nutritionist	O
can	O
help	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
told	O
her	O
that	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O
that	O
I	O
need	O
her	O
to	O
take	O
her	O
blood	O
sugar	O
before	O
breakfast	O
,	O
lunch	O
,	O
dinner	O
and	O
sleep	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
come	O
back	O
in	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
a	O
half	O

so	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
what	O
was	O
really	O
going	O
on	O
and	O
whether	O
they	O
are	O
getting	O
too	O
low	O
.	O

She	O
denies	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
symptoms	O
with	O
even	O
as	O
low	O
a	O
blood	O
sugar	O
as	O
19	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
wondering	O
if	O
she	O
is	O
remembering	O
all	O
these	O
blood	O
sugars	O
correctly	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
no	O

no	O

no	O

no	O
nothing	O

She	O
felt	O

So	O
hopefully	O
she	O
will	O
really	O
record	O
these	O

and	O
we	O
will	O
get	O
a	O
